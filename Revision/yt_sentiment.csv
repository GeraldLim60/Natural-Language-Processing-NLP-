here in nz 50 of retailers don’t even have contactless credit card machines like paywave which support apple pay they don’t like the high fees that come with these,0
i will forever acknowledge this channel with the help of your lessons and ideas explanations now its quite helpful while youll just sit at your comfort and monitor your account growth,1
whenever i go to a place that doesn’t take apple pay doesn’t happen too often it’s such a drag between ‘contactless covid’ habits and my getting the apple card i’ve gotten so used to apple pay that i get seriously annoyed when a store doesn’t take it it feels like a shock it’s crazy how quickly it took over my shopping routine i’ve officially been brainwashed by apple because now it feels so inconvenient to even carry a physical card in my pocket,0
apple pay is so convenient secure and easy to use i used it while at the korean and japanese airports no need for physical credit cards,1
we only got apple pay in south africa in 20202021 and it’s widely accepted,1
in the united states we have an abundance of retailers that accept apple pay but its still good to carry the physical card with you being there are still a large quantity of places that do not accept apple pay,1
wow you really went to town on the psu test rack thats a serious bit of kit very flexible good choices wouldnt surprise me if choma start offering this bespoke rack to the psu makers they all watch your videos so theyll want to make sure it passes on this exact same rack you can really push the industry here well done open source the test interface hardware and software,1
the lab is the most exciting thing in it ive seen for a while this is reallly going to shake up how the qualiity of even basic components are manufactured,1
linus im an engineer and love the lmg content across all the channels very much looking forward to more lab content and hope your engineering team will get more on camera time and hosting roles,1
there used to be a time where linus was the smartest guy in the room this video clearly shows that the team he has built are experts in their respective fields and make linus look like a child kudos to linus and lmg youve grown beyond what i imagined all the best,1
holy crap i was looking at chroma systems back when i was designing power supplies looks like you guys went all out re the multimeter most oscilloscopes are terrible for making accurate voltage measurements 810 bit adcs they are just for looking at the waveforms,0
i love the direction this channel is going most tech channels even the best trusted ones are going to review products based on their own experience or at most some things they can measure with their pc but youre really going to mathematically demonstrate if a product is a quality one and why it is love it,1
i am more excited for the ltt lab than i have been for a lot of content for a while now as everyone seems to be saying its exciting to see how enthusiastic this new crew is to get things running,1
i adore the working relationship linus has with his team 99 of employees walk on eggshells around their boss and i wish it could be more like this,1
lmgs growth is honestly something to truly aspire for this is the content we want to watch more technical in depth engineering oriented and sciencebased content will make us consumers much much more educated on these topics thus when picking a product not only will we pick the best choice but well know exactly why we picked it which helps greatly with buyers remorse,1
i love all the people ltt has added for labs clearly theyre knowledgeable and passionate about tech labs is gonna be killer love it,1
linus just turn the key lights 180 and bounce them off the walls you’ll get a much softer glow and shadow and way more even lighting it’s such a simple fix i’m not sure where along the lines people got the idea to beam the lights directly at your face ,1
dan continues to be my new favorite he has such an air of confidence about him and a comforting presence like dan shows up and you just know things are going to be fine,1
dan managing to set up his soldering station on the one box they needed was incredibly amusing to me,1
linus gets on his employees cases for all the stuff stolen from the office also linus proudly talks about all the stuff stolen from work hes using in his upgraded setup linus why are you using this monitor as a table also linus uses the monitor as a chair this video was hilarious,1
dan the man saving the day riley needs to give him his own theme like brian the electrician,1
dan continues to be a favourite for me hes like the incredibly patient but longsuffering dad who just gets on with things,1
dan is a treasure your channel has long lacked a mr fixit type and while i am sad its not me dan appears quite capable and funny,1
blows my mind how quickly dan became the rock upon which all things linus standslove it,1
hey linus a good trick for streaming lights bounce them off the wall much easier on the eyes and a nice softer look also for indoors id recommend a hypercardioid mic looks like a short shotgun like the audiotechnica at4053b,1

everyone has been saying it but i’ll throw my hat in as well to any prospective college students you do not need to spend money on flagship products i am about to graduate with a business degree and have been using a 7 year old laptop and the base ipad from late 2020 both products have worked flawlessly and i have no intention of replacing them the recommendations listed are ones i would never be able to afford even with my job i’m working as well do your own research on forums to see what your peers say the best value product is i promise that if you buy a flagship product you will quickly see that you did not need it,1
shoutout to my oneplus phone and huawei laptop for getting me through university feeling premium for much less bonus ups for ikeas articulating lamps 20 and i can see all my homework incredibly well without eye strain the old door i refinished to use as a desktop and wired earbuds under hardware store earmuffs as my noisecancelling headphones and the same 2 sets of hanes underwear from target for also lasting the whole ride,1
you dont necessarily need the highend and latest tech for university i used a 2009 macbook pro throughout my years at uni had an iphone 6 and it worked out just fine whats important is to remain focused on getting that degree and graduating,1
personally i feel like this is really out of touch most students wont be able to afford these in case anyone needs it i believe dave2ds back to school video are honestly the best ones ive seen on the topic consider checking them out too before making a purchase decision,1
hey everyone good take on the video and love the recommendations if you plan on making another video such as this maybe you can also include some more budget options and best value options what i can tell from my years of studying in college and university is that your tech and needs will be based on what coursesprogramme you took for your education engineering students require computer specs that can run bim software im not sure about the other programmes but from what i can see that most students at my place has 8gb of ram for their laptops also here is my setup during my university years hope it can help anyone who are looking to buy something for their collegeuniversity years all the best laptop asus x455l upgraded to ssd with additional ram phone vivo y69redmi 10samsung a22 4g mouse logitech g102 keyboard tecware tkl ver,1
i have used galaxy tab s7 during my phd its been a lifesaver for me first of all it is really good for reading journals note taking and scribbling on the pdfs secondly it doesnt strain your eye that much when you use a computer or a laptop always at a fixed distance thirdly you get the premium version of noteshelf free with tab s7 and lastly if you are from a stem background and use a lot of illustrations or flow process diagrams you can draw those easily with the stylus on tab s7 i choose tab s7 over apple ipad air for its ease of use user interface and cost you get stylus for free with tab s7 and in most cases keyboard too with a huge student discount,1
this series is exactly what career day shouldve been such interesting and knowledgeable people,1
how does every person wired brings on this show act like theyve been in front of cameras 5000 times,0
his face when describing hops killed me “some of them smell pretty… dank “,0
seasoned craft brewery tour guide here and i’m so glad he ended on “drink what you like” sometimes people get weirdly judgmental about the beer preferences of others at the end of the day there are hundreds of beer styles for a reason so everyone can find at least one style they actually like,1
this guy is a total bro not snobby at all and just wants people to enjoy beer in whatever way they want such a contrast with your stereotypical beverage elitists,1
y’all be picking the literal best professionals for these videos not only is everyone knowledgeable but they all seem passionate and eager to teach us,1
this guy has a face made for movies a voice made for radio and a great personality i wanna see more of garrett,1
whenever we get people young enough to actually understand the internet these giant tech companies might be broken up but as long as we have 90 year old senators asking tech ceos how the internet works nothing will get done,0
i live for johns roasts of att,1
mad respect to john oliver and his team for not making us watch ads during the show major props,1
one important aspect im surprised was left out is that many of these companies like amazon literally power the internet almost 30 of the websites on the internet are stored on amazon servers giving them even more access to data trends and physical control over the internet,1
back in 2018 when john oliver did the episode on corporate consolidation it inspired me so much that i applied for a masters of research program got into a program and did my entire research thesis on tech oligopolies it was shocking to see how bad it really is oligopolies that bordered in monopolies are rampant my research essentially focused on the question of whether lack of enforcement of our antitrust laws caused this whole problem or whether lack of adequate laws were the core of the issue the answer was that it was truly both i thoroughly enjoyed my predoctoral masters thesis and am considering a phd in the future its so lovely to see john talk about this specifically on the tech sector edit wow thanks everyone for the great comments i havent published it yet otherwise i would share it with all you lovely people  i am now looking for a policy or qualitative researchanalyst job so if anyone is hiring let me know ,0
john oliver deserves an oscar for his can dolphins love you monologue,1
hey something that might interest you a couple of days ago my amazon account was closed with no warning for after hours of wasted time theyre telling me its for excessive returns which i think is an error but thats beside the point when they closed my amazon account all my amazon devices that i own for years primarily all my echo devices stopped working i lost access to the amazon photos and prime video which i pay for so apparently the devices you already own are subject to be disabled by amazon on your perceived shopping habits i assume the same applies to all other amazon devices and services like fire os tablets ring cameras and probably aws as well just wanted to make other people aware of this because they definitely dont tell you this when you buy your hardware and services,0
hey hey just a heads up i did turn the led hoodie on its just not very bright hen youre looking faceon at it you can still sort of see it on around the hood area though  if you had fun on this video heres my collection of extreme unboxing videos,1
the safety belt wouldve paired perfectly with the unicycle and those roller boot things,1
that was seriously the most enjoyable thing ive seen in awhile i forgot how rad this channel is well done sir,1
dude i love how genuine your reactions were ive had fun watching this and not only i was really interested to see what each one of those gadgets did,1
infinity dodecahedrons are seriously cool i bought another smaller one and i really enjoy it its definitely an eye catcher and a conversation starter,1
i personally enjoy the old school phones i have such a hard time hearing my iphone at max volume without the speaker on if i worked in an office i would definitely buy one people forget how ergonomic those old phones are its not particularly comfortable holding a rectangle to your head i also have physically sensitive ears so any type of headphones ear phones whatever cause me a bunch of pain looks like a good product that can both be a gag and something for people out there like me who have a tough time using a regular mobile phone,1
the fact he didnt buy the nicholas cage spoon is outrageous,0
i have to say it after watching this video it feels like the journey youre on this year has been effective it simply feels like youre enjoying life and its what i enjoy most about watching your videos you manage to pass that joy on just the musings of a random stranger ,1
i havent laughed like this for years oh my gosh arun youve nailed this one wendi ,1
quality quality quality is everything about this channel arun makes my mood happier video after video lets be searious the best part about this channel is arun making his jokes and when he shows tech,1
as somebody with a comp sci degree and a decent amount of irl experience i will say edge computing is problematic at its core because client side workload like this is a huge security breach this is why even online video games avoid client side scripting it is a huge vector for exploit it is always interesting to watch a video like this because you are blown away when you listen regarding these other technologies you may not know allot about but when they cover a technology you know about you realize you must question the quality of the info in the other cases where you cannot determine the quality yourself,0
the fire suppression without water was incredible it could save many lives and property especially if it could be auto activated like a heat detector imagine how much property and how many sleeping people could be saved especially if this had a built in alarm and was rigged to keep hallways clear of fire what an inventionwow,1
id really appreciate a study into the potential advantages of meta materials in manipulating light emf heat and even replacing silicon as semiconductors nearly every industry can benefit from the improvements and cost reductions meta materials can provide really enjoy your videos thank you,1
i was totally shocked that fusion power generation wasnt included possibly as big a leap as quantum computing in its impact on humanity,0
i love the one about the hydrogen fuel cellsconsidering this technology has been around for about 20 yearsjust hasnt been used due to a lack of pressure on the industry and the fact that the patent was buried by large corporate interests,1
i wish that when people talked about types of skin damage theyd acknowledge what that looks like for people with darker skin we dont get red rashes after sunburn even my darkest bruises are often difficult to spot because of hyperpigmentation the stages of healing for cuts looks vastly different because we dont see the same change in colors around the wound sight not to mention when you look for images to identify clinical signs 99 of those images are of lighter skin and only marginally helpful to us looking to identify potentially serious medical issues,0
she has a very effective way of delivering information in a way that is accessible love her,1
if the lead singer is bret michaels then im sure it is poison that had me laughing for ages ,1
anne is so cool she makes me want to reevaluate my life choices and return to college to become a toxicologist,1
poison support is one of the more interesting ones of this series im glad to see anne back in the seat and schooling us hoping for more,1
my son had botox injections in his legs for years to relax his muscles enough so he could wear splits he has cerebral palsy its crazy knowing that this life changing treatment is also the most dangerous poison,0
my mom wouldve gone nuts for you while i was growing up lol her big parent fear was toxic chemicals and me getting poisoned so she was always lecturing me about stuff under the sink and making sure i didnt touch the pesticides for the farm once she figured out she could call pbs and theyd send her mr yuck stickers the house and barn were covered in them,0
i love how she says that it is poison in the right dose instead of the wrong dose,1
my husband got sun poisoning last year all the symptoms you described it was not fun he said his sick were he got burned felt tight for a few months after luckily he is a nurse and he was able to give me advice on how to help him in his recovery,0
marques does a fantastic job highlighting the features of the link if youre looking for the next level of webcam look no further  dope tech dope video,1
the camera is amazing and there are so many people who could benefit from it a lot,1
i’ve been playing with the insta360 link for about a week now as a college professor and edtech trainer i can tell you that this is a complete game changer for online and hybrid teaching switching from follow mode to whiteboard mode to topdown mode for demos etc is a purely magical experience,1
i honestly have to say while its still insanely expensive 3500 for that monitor isnt as bad as i was expecting and its almost reasonable like its still more than i would ever spend on a single display and im far more into having separate displays but given what its capable of the specs the tech behind it etc its not that bad i can see a few people getting real use out of something like that,1
imagine losing the cursor on that screen and trying to find it ,0
this monitor is perfect for streaming three 27“ monitors in one is amazing  but man is it expensive ,1
i can see this being good for editing and streaming reading the chat and playing the game on one screen this is genius,1
geez i need a dedicated studio for all of this dope tech in my future,1
this has gotta be one of the best dope techs everything here is a hit that i’m def writing down for later,1
i’m always looking forward to these every month so thank you for making them honestly that little lamp and speaker caught my eye the flickering is really cool to me and the speaker is a nice extra,1
the sound test killed me that was hilarious and the wrist rest is brilliant i often get marks on my wrist from my mousepad,1
what a tough selection this month whether it be the soundbar the lamp speaker or even the pc panel display they all seem something that would really improve my set up but for me it may have to be the soundbar one looks smart has nice rgb and a decent size and price very good month of tech this month,1
i absolutely love this series all of the items were neat but the only one i would actually benefit from would be the chair wheels i have a regular office chair that has to roll on carpet and it is kind of a pain,1
that sensor panel is definitely convenient been wanting to make my own with a raspberry pi but just find myself getting off track super cool to just be able to purchase and go,1
the rgb sound bar would be perfect for my setup i’ve been using the speakers in my monitor as my main sound system so it would be a nice upgrade for me,1
i always love franks energy i also look forward to the end of every month thinking about this series i love the tiltednation soundbar and i need that for my set up,1
always great to see this series so many cool things this month my office setup could use those chair wheels,1
this series has helped me and my friends find some helpful tech that has helped our setups the pc panel is gonna be a huge upgrade,1
we need the under 100 for august as well this is the best series out there,1
one really important point those ionizers can produce potentially dangerous levels of ozone due to the negative ions they create in the air id be cautious of all air ionizers unless they are advertised specifically as bipolar ionizers the one that you recommended does produce ozone which can be very harmful,0
been a good while since ive been a student but i still watched the vid to find out what cool gadgets are out there didnt think id be walking away from it with a productivity tip that idea of the simple timer is so good instead of devices that can also do time great vid frank,1
the desktop lamp is definitely my favorite it’s also something i’ve been looking for because i updated to a keyboard that doesn’t have shine through keycaps so it’s definitely a need too,1
i’m not a student however i always love seeing the tech always looking to change and upgrade my desk setup for work,1
fantastic video frank you always bring really cool stuff to the front that most of us havent seenheard anything about hope you and the fam are doing well xd btw that kb for only 100 i know theyve gotten a lot cheaper but hot damn i dont need it but i want it lol my biggest complaint with 60 kbs is the lack of arrow keys and this has those and looks super sleek with those colors love it take care man,1
ugh hate when my summer holidays end at least you brighten my mood with this top tech series thanks,1
awesome variety of products i also like that you had more than five or six items love the budget finds ,1
you missed a feature on the airbolt instead of using the big part of the loop to lock your zippers lock the zippers on the loop where the 2 notches are that way you cant open the bag 3 inches,0
its so crazy to me ive watched you all the way through middle school till college now over six years and youve grown so much keep working big man reguardless of your age middle school highschool collegeuniversity we gotchu covered,1
 for all the coffee lovers don’t forget to check out cometeer and save 20 on your first order   watch best gifts under 20,1
the kablecard is by far my favorite item on this list when i first saw you have it on the channel i immediately bought it so easy to carry and being able to charge anything with it is great,1
i just wanted to say thank you for making such amazing content we notice all the hard work you do and appreciate it so much,1
as a specialty coffee lover those cometeer pods are amazing if i didnt enjoy the long process it takes to brew a fresh cup of coffee id 100 buy them all the time,1
i wasn’t prepared for the immediate start lol,0
thanks for consistently providing great videos every time i purchase a new device i come to your channel to find out the best products for it,1
love these accessories you always make great videos,1
love your videos i really hope one day you make a worksite edc like for construction workers or electricians much love,1
love watching your videos just waiting for that best accessories for pixel 6 video,1
love your vids mankeep up the good work,1
be careful with the katchy they are known to start smoking at the top so possible fire hazard its possible that this issue could have been fixed with the newer models but just giving you a heads up great video,1
am i the only one that actually watches these with snacks and drinks  been here since 1 ,1
gotta let your son pick some boxes now he’s old enough to point one out start him in the family business early ,1
i love all the interactions and laughs with everyone in this video personally i think j picked the best tech,1
okay j that 130 was definitely worth it i might get me one a good buy for a traveling tech head,1
still the best series to watch while indulging in a meal cant believe its already the 47th video,1
i absolutely love your wife’s expressions when she’s interacting with you another gundam play games with you giggle… cracks me up,1
thanks for the heads up about grover im a tech reviewer and had never heard of it could be a really nice way for me to get my hands on some items to review very appreciated,1
i love you guys i hope you know that  you guys brighten my day with these massive tech unboxing videos,1
the whole idea of the interchangeable battery to keep going of the steel series is exactly the reason why xbox still uses aa batteries for their controllers i think is in an undervalued decision from xbox,0
in my experience burnout comes from realizing that improved performance doesnt produce improved rewards it produces more work the response to a job well done is never a couple days off or a timely bonus instead good work is rewarded with the demand for twice as much work in the same amount of time firms see young workers as a productivity sponge to be squeezed for all its worth young people are almost never treated as the companys future,0
i am 50 years old working in the high tech industry mentally tired and sick of the weekly 8 to 5 routine never got a proper day off even through the pandemic hats off to the millenials and genz that think differently and put more weight on living rather than just working,0
i think the pandemic has taught people the importance of multiple streams of income unfortunately having a job doesn’t mean security,0
successful people dont become that way overnight what most people see at a glance wealth a great career purposeis the result of hard work and hustle over time i pray that anyone who reads this will be successful in life,1
as someone who used to work 80 hours a week quitting my job to become a freelancer was the best thing i have ever done sure i still work a lot of hours and often close to 7080 hrs a week i feel like i am doing this for myself and not some corporation,1
i have a high paying tech job that i’m about to leave i feel incredibly blessed and privileged to have had it even though i worked hard to get to where i am i was promoted very fast after 5 years i know it’s something many people would love to have and honestly i’m happy that someone else who has worked hard will get my spot ultimately i became burnt out and just need some time to reset my life i have lived humbly saved every thing i could paid off debts as quickly as possible and have enough to live for 8 months to a year i’m hoping to come back into the industry as a healthier employee or have found something else fulfilling for anyone wishing they had one of these jobs or feel frustrated by people that appear to be complaining i hope you achieve your dream and get one you can do it keep at it taking one of these jobs to be financially secure is a blessing i am taking a break because my mental health and stress hospitalized me don’t let that scare you i just have my own personal stuff too ,1
i’m a software developer i understand the struggle but us tech workers should count our lucky stars we are very privileged to be where we are most jobs outside of tech have less perks much lower pay and more stress i am grateful everyday to be in this field once i accumulate enough wealth to purchase my freedom i’ll see myself out maybe in the meantime i will run the race as long as i have to,1
the thing is if you give someone all of these perks and a flexible schedule you need to also give them the freedom to use that flexibility you must make it clear that the company expects you to take down time and you will not be frowned upon either officially or unofficially leadership needs to model that behavior by taking time off and making sure everyone knows theyre taking time off this also empowers your teams letting them know that you trust them to work without constantly staring over their shoulders,1
compare that to physicians only 42 said they were burned out yes indeed a perfectly acceptable percentage,1
i worked a low paying tech job for six years and still felt the burn out the problem is that tech is very fast paced and competition focused you can barely keep up though i got promoted regularly my higher ups told me the truth before they left they said that i was severely underpaid based on my skills essentially i branded myself a one stop shop for the marketing department as i am both technically knowledgeable people oriented and strategic i maxed out at 50k so i decided to jump ship with little planned now i run a financial agency with my husband and we make 250k a year as entrepreneurs and we have the freedom to set our own lifestyle,0
that boat pod looks a lot like a saiyan space capsule… i need one lol,1
those window breakers seems like an easy way to rob someone’s car,0
i would love the glasses and the digital artwork frame,1
cool ,1
nice i love it,1
damn the mueral canvas is nice too pricey,0
if you could limit your products to things that are available retail it would be awesome kickstarter and indiegogo etc dont count too many scams and failed products and no protections,0
from all the stuff mentioned i have the dji mic amazing recording device,1
this guy must be the richest youtuber i hear his voice on most tech channel ,1
from all the stuff mentioned i have the dji mic amazing recording device,1
that motion alarm for protecting your laptop makes me laugh if you are taking a break away from your workplace do you really think that the alarm feature would deter a thief from simply knocking the device to the floor pick up the laptop and perhaps step on the alarm and crush it in a moment of disdain by the time you get back with your latte after your phone notifies you of your impending bad luck your laptop will be off on an extended trip,0
that cable organiser would be incredible in my dorm room,1
the trene control alarm will not deter someone who really wants it they will just knock that gadget off and run with your property,0
enjoyed your video and i gave it a thumbs up,1
i spent hours researching dash cams a year or so ago and it’s almost maddening how awful sparse and misrepresented information on dash cams is i was totally surprised how under developed they are this is a video that is really necessary,0
vids like these are definitely a service for looking out for everyone to avoid buying crap and hype in dashcams well done in the research thanks ltt,1
i did not expect to love this video as much as i did it epitomizes the very best of youtube in my opinion a wellmade video with a wellconstructed narrative hosted flawlessly and provides a genuinely good service to everyone even if they are not in the market for these products love your work ltt team,1
thank you linus for spending the big bucks and testing all these cameras for our benefit i will be keeping your recommendations in mind when i purchase my camera,1
this is the kind of content that we need calling out trash markets and helping people find honest answers doing the sidebyside comparisons they cant do thanks for this glad to know the rove r24k i got as a gift is not far from really the peak in the market and is good enough if not overpriced a bit,1
yup its amazing though how the market then changes brands for each country in germany we have an entirely different line of knockoff chinese brands which ultimately look alike same goes for the australian american market i am kinda stoked to see though what sort of dashcams are actually used within south korea japan if anybody could give a hint to that i mean surely they must have great dashcams right japan being the leading technology country in the 80s and having a severe amount of car enthusiasts and well south korea being well the main birth place of any technology centre and fab well at least a good portion in my mind i bought this one due to a recommendation from a friend of mine problem i have with it is quality related the gsensor broke not long after i bought the thing and started using it kinda unfortunate this creates an issue of the thing constantly making emergency recordings and in that mode you cant disable the screen from flashing so at night drives youll really get beamed in your faze and think someone put a flashlight up to your head nope its your f dashcam you can improve further the video quality for eg when experincing intense sun glare which is usually caused on these by using a ndfilter you just have to find your own way to mount them usually there is full filter clamping solutions because youll have to overshoot with the filter anyhow i didnt do this yet as i did not find it nessecary to do so but a big german dashcam clip compilation maker did recommend this in one of his dashcam review videos half a year ago or so name of the channel is eure videos fahrnünftig german amazon thieye cv3211 american market jansite nexigo d80 australian nz market volway,1
in all fairness the viofo actually looks pretty great actually worth considering over the thinkware f70 if the budget isnt too tight,1
when i went looking for a dashcam my main criteria was that it has a super cap instead of a battery cause i really dont think the batteries would handle the 20 to 30c temps in winter and the exact opposite in the summer along with however much the sun heats up the interior i know you can take them off but i kinda wanted an install and forget about it kind of system for actual performance its much better to just find someone elses footage cause the resolution and other specs are very misleading unless you really know your camera sensor specs,0
i had my suspicions about this for a long time thank you for finally calling this issue out it sounds like theres a hole in the market for a truly high quality dashcam thats not chinese crap hopefully some tech company sees this and swoops in im tired of all these countless trash brands on amazon with unpronounceable names,0
ive been wanting to make this video for such a long time that royole display was just so hard to get hold of by holy cow was it worth it to check out my other ridiculous tech unboxings,0
i love the fact that you put “thinnest rick roll” and “can you legally employ a cat” on the search history even if it flashed on the screen for a second you are one of the only creators that put 100 effort and detail into their content keep it up,1
i’d say the coolest thing in this video is the desk pc saves room and it’s cool to see the desk but i wonder how much it cost and if it’s worth buying,1
im just here to say thank you to him the generosity he has shown will forever be in my heart thanks for the perfect job,1
i own a remarkable 2 and that feeling surreal to hold was the same thing i felt when i got it its great for anyone wanting a device to write with for school and so much thinner and easier to carry around than a notebook or binder especially since you can import and export pdfs for downloading and submitting assignments online,1
man i love how he went from a smartphone focused creator to just all inventions overall this is incredible keep it up arun ,1
thankyou for the effort you put into your videos you spend thousands on each video just for your fans respect ,1
that desk pc is now on my bucket list ,1
i love the fact that you put hilarious search histories at 233 this is the kind of content youtubers need to make keep up the good work ,1
install raid for free  iosandroidpc and get a special starter pack  available only for the next 30 days this is the best iphone accessory in 2022  like these wallpapers download them here  iphone 14 magsafe accessories ,1
in spite of the huge upgrades especially for the pro models it would be interesting to see how many will upgrade to the iphone 14 lineup given that the iphone 13 lineup is as popular as ever,1
honestly can’t wait for the camera testing you do on the pros as a iphone 8 user anything will be an improvement though lol,1
definitely upgrading from my 12 pro max to the 14 pro max ill get at least half the cost of the new phone back with trade in major upgrade in battery camera and the screen,1
in my opinion the 13 mini is the best phone ever made seems i’m in a minority but it’s brilliant,1
eh i’m sticking with my 13 pro max until probably the 15 or 16 the cameras on the 14 pros are literally the biggest worthwhile change this year imo,1
im going to wait for the scheduled iphone 15 pro which will be scheduled to release in october 2023 if everything goes to plan it is expected to have a usb c port and faster charging like the iphone 14 series this is what really matters for me,1
i might upgrade from my 11 pro to the 14 max i guess i don’t care enough to spend the money on the pro max but i want the bigger display and better battery life,1
the information is easily digestible thanks,1
this guy is so professional and has such a calm aura about him exactly what i would like my doctor to have,1
this guy is just wonderful i like that sense of humor in a doctor dr what is wrong with me yes,1
i had a great time with these questions thanks wired ,1
109 ‘no just you’ actually got me i love how they choose professionals with such great fun and easy going personalitiesit makes science a little less nerdy,1
seriously how are these weird topics so engaging probably the professionals they feature but this is a fantastic series,1
as someone with ulcerative colitis im glad to see gastrointestinal issues being put on the spotlight as well as a specialist educating people on this taking care of yourself before it becomes chronic is key,1
had the pleasure of working at the same practice as dr iroku during his time in nc he truly is just as nice in person as he appears in this video so nice to see a familiar face,1
dr iroku has nailed perfect balance of being fun and informative while remaining professional perfect for this series,1
reminder do not fall for the fake telegram and whatsapp accounts trying to have you claim a prize through texting them its fake and a scam i personally contact the winners through my official account only,0
this was one of the best cool tech episodes in a while wow that pocket operator was awesome and i dont even make music,1
i used to have that audio interface 1010 for those who wanna switch from a usb mic to xlr great choice of items this month frank ,1
love those pocket operators never heard of them until this video and now ive done a ton of research on em lol would like to pick one up someday thanks for bringing this dope tech to our attention good sir,1
that led message board is super cool so many options for use love watching your videos and seeing all of the cool affordable tech,1
love the wormier keyboard i have a full size keyboard and the compact option looks amazing and will be a better fit for my small desk,1
i love how theres infinite possibilities that you can do with the pocket operator would love to pick up one of those for exploring it,1
my favorite cool tech gadget in this episode was definitely the audio interface as i am starting to get into the streaming world great episode and for the amazing content,1
gotta say this is one of the best episodes of the series in a while i actually think every single one of these things would be something id go out to buy especially the led sign i finally am picking back up my plan to build my own pc and the flexibility of the sign adds a lot of well flexibility on how i want my endgame to turn out,1
teachers there are no stupid questions wolfgang puck well tracey thats a stupid question,0
hes a nice fun guy he told my dad at an event my dad was cooking at that he had never seen so many steaks cooked so perfectly so quickly and its one of his favorite memories we have a signed picture with him and my parents in it d,1
idk if this was intentional but i really like how he said “practice makes better” rather than “practice makes perfect”,1
“have a drink or smoke a joint” thanks chef i’ll do both,1
i think its kinda cool that elizabeth haigh sent the tweet about nervous breakdowns the same month she opened her restaurant and now that her question is being answered she has a michellin star,1
i like that he mentioned the omelette thing many years ago i took culinary classes when i considered trying to become a chef and an instructor i had emphasized the importance of a good omelette for restaurant interviews glad to know i wasnt led astray in that,1
i can’t wait to put edible flowers all over my morning cheerios,1
i love how hes wearing a bracelet that says allergic to stupidity,1
the price of todays bikes is absolutely bonkers doesnt make any sense whatsoever if you compare it to motorcycles or even cars,0
the price of the roadgoing kawasaki really tells how overpriced the push bikes are,0
fun fact about horsepower its the amount of power a horse can sustain for an entire day so a galloping horse actually has 15 horsepower,1
i love and ride both types of two wheeled transportation  gcntech your talking my language,1
another great video two  thumbs up i know little to nothing about about motorcycle riding nevertheless the gcn team once again has brought another layer to overall world of cycling which for me makes even more interesting wishing the best for scott his team ,1
this was a fascinating look at something i love by some genuinely interested people i will add that you can build a significantly cheaper race bike for a lower key series and still have fun on the track i have a minitwin which is relatively cheap to run but a friend of mine has a litre plus missile and every time he crashes it it costs about £5k and six months at least to fix however i far prefer long adventure rides to whizzing around the track all of which you can do on a minitwin ,1
as a lapsed superbike obsessive it always bothered me hearing gcn call top road bikes superbikes now i mostly watch cycling and im used to it,0
hanging onto my 8t for now curious to see what oneplus does after the 10 overall coz the 9 10 didnt move me they keep constantly moving from what made them great with each variant  the oneplus 6 being their last great phone,1
i’m waiting for the oneplus 10s or p or q,1
pretty happy with the oneplus 9 camera is killer for sunny days on the beach the oneplus carbon fiber case makes it feel excellent in the hand,1
oneplus have been making some solid looking hardware these days that being said it does feel like they have been sort of trying to become the next samsung with the number of phones that they have been launching,1
you are the only youtuber who compared these two phones for the first time thank you so much ,1
always here for u chris mad respect,1
oppo did oneplus so dirty  heart breaks for oneplus fans rip oxygen os and oneplus,0
man oneplus is in the wrong direction after carl pei left from flagship killer to forgettable company,0
nice one zoe great job keep us up to date on the latest computer programming news great job ,1
lots of profit negative tech startup companies with an over abundant of overpaid employees…honestly who hasn’t seen this coming,0
what slowdown lol it was abnormally fast and now with the recession vcs realized many of these startups aren’t profitable so they laid off people the big ones are still hiring and tech adoption isn’t nearly as much for it to slow down anytime soon,0
slow hirings may be caused by a rapid rising labor cost in hi tech ind,0
thats really a problem with service economy most tech companies dont even produce a nail they do things that are intangible you cay easily live without them if netflix goes down i am sure there will not be any catastrophic event if some manufacturing companies goes down lets say the one that makes baby formula it could trigger a panic,0
good video as usual ,1
the future of tech is looking more and more amazing,1
the future of tech is soo beautiful,1
good day future tech i noticed your excellent video and am impressed with your amazing sharing on products wed love to collab on a new product experience were working on what would be the best email to contact you,1
could coolper become the average new yorker’s dream hmm make that every ‘coffee lover’ can’t help but notice pixy’s here again a nice hands free it is,1
enjoyed your video and i gave it a thumbs up for the support of your channel,1
209 so im guessing when you make an ad for your product do you really want a guy sleeping right in the middle with an it is what it is pillow lol while everyone else is having fun 237 and that blistering scooter speed of 030 meters per hour i think you meant kilometers per hour all in all pretty cool stuff i like the coolper i can really see that taking off huupe seems to be novelty i can imagine the horror as soon as someone forgets there is a tv there and slams a ball only to shatter the device lol the life straw actually works ive seen several science channels take pond water and view it under a microscope then filter it and view it again it really does work but it does not filter out chemicals in the water just microparticles and microbes,1
im over this channel because 90 of the products they feature in their videos are on kickstarter and honestly at this point they should change the name from kick starter to never starter lol im just saying as im also laughing my butt off because that was hella funny and its also hella true and yes it was also hella shady as well sorry i couldnt help myself anyway back to my point because trust me its a really good point and just in case youre still laughing let me get you back on track so like i said 90 of the products featured on this channel and its sister channel or products that are on kickstarter and about 80 to 90 of the products on kickstarter never even make it to market thats right you read that correct and my numbers are correct because i did my research so basically this channel future tech and its sister channel the future is now both channels are useless because over 90 of the products that they show you you will never ever be able to purchase so basically honestly its a waste of everybodys youtube time unless you like looking at videos that feature products and gadgets that will never come to market and that you will never be able to purchase seriously on being funny and sarcastic but also serious because honestly im so over it and im over this channel thats why i have unsubscribe and im telling everybody else to unsubscribe so have you unsubscribed please everybody unsubscribe because at this point in time future tech and the future is now and all those channels that display products that are on kickstarter and the keyword here is display because basically all the products are prototypes that are on display and the public will never be able to buy them because they will never come to market oh kickstarter oops im sorry i mean never starter oh my god im sorry i couldnt help myself because its still so funny lol  but like i said these products never end up going to market and never end up being sold so this whole useless channel is a waste of my time and your time and everybody elses time okay now guess what times up so goodbye and remember everybody please do yourself a big favor and unsubscribe,1
awesome,1
this lady is awesome her voice makes my throat hurt but i could watch her for hours,1
for all people after covid who want their smell back i did exactly what she described but went a step further and tried to smell back first smells i used to hate or made me want to puke i feel that it trully helped getting my smell back faster the hate in our brain is a true booster it just triggers something xd please let me know if it worked for you too wishing all a speed recovery 3,1
it still blows my mind that companies have entire teams deciding whether or not a flavor is going to appeal to the masses and yet somehow swedish fish flavored oreos were still greenlit,0
that “section of the tongue” theory is so funny to me because it’s what i was taught as a fact in my high school anatomy class and i was trying to test that out on my own and never could i would always taste every flavor no matter where it was in my mouth i have never heard anyone say it wasn’t true so it’s cool to hear now,1
this woman is unbelievably amazing i want a phd in taste and i want her to be my professor i’m a lawyer and after this one video i’m prepared to quit and pursue taste ,1
what she said about the packaging affecting the taste is so true i always think delivery pizza smells so good and it’s the pizza in the cardboard box that makes it smell amazing just not the same without the box ,1
when i was a kid in kindergarten we did an experiment with that old fake five flavors taste zones thing and i never got it i could always taste everything on every part of my tongue i felt vindicated like two decades later when it came out that that was horsecrap but i cant exactly go rub it in my kindergarten teachers face can i,0
the amount of people wired gets to interview is amazingall of them has the passion of the kinds of job they r doing idk if job is the right word to use when ua doing something what u love,1
also the amount of carbonation to syrup isnt set in the soda machines and can be changed a soda with more carbonation is a dry soda a restaurant i loved would mix their own rootbeer syrup and you could ask for it to be a dry or sweet whichever was your preference,1
maybe its because i know shes an audiologist but she annunciates everything beautifully and speaks with an even sound level like she clearly works with the hearing impared to naturally say every sound in a word to be heard as easily as possible,1
i’m so glad she talked about how hearing aids are more complicated than just a mic and speaker as someone who has had two of them since i’ve been four i’ve had to explain that so many times also having automatic bluetooth ears is super cool,1
my doctor also told me that our ears are selfcleaning but when i pressured her for some offtherecord advice she finally conceded that if i really really felt the need to clean inside my ear canal i could go ahead and use my elbows i just adore my doctor,1
brilliant wellspoken wellenunciated and a welcoming and animated face great video i learned a lot,1
the way i was hyped to to this i was born with hearing loss so i had to see many audiologist in my life so far people like her made my life so much easier her talking about hearing aids and clearing up misconceptions or even spreading knowledge made me smile ear to ear,1
about earplugs at concerts there are a variety of frequencybalanced earplugs that protect your hearing while preserving the sound quality of the music eargasm and hearos are a couple of examples i highly recommend them,1
honestly my main take away is that ive been saying tinnitus wrong my whole life,0
loved this as someone who previously studied to be an audiologist in the past also just love all of the expert answers videos on this channel thanks wired and dr emily,1
this was super fascinating although the part about the ear drum being able to self repair was the most surprising to me,1
the universal hate for printers is what unites humanity,0
i suddenly gained immense amount of respect for dyson after watching this,1
im just shocked and saddened that theyve ignored the most significant vacuum cleaner advance the retractable cord,0
you know you’ve made it in life when you can wear glasses like that with absolute conviction,1
james dyson is actually giving really good advice here a lot of these types of qas give really generic advice,1
probably the best interviewanswers so far he leaps off the screen with his eloquent and articulate manner it is very apparent that he is simply a genius,1
this was so entertaining i had no idea the person behind dyson was a true genuine and passionate inventor and to see him speak so nicely about independent designers and the unfair problems they face was amazing,1
james dyson makes legendary household appliances like vacums and hair dryers also james dyson loves his cast aluminum pencil sharper the little things in life,1
your videos make my weekend it is something perfect that i can watch with my 4yearold what we have lunch and it distracts him because his mom is leaving to work your videos honestly are lifesavers thank you,1
858 i got the remarkable as a note takingplanner its has a great design really lightweight and better than carrying a note book or two subscription depending who you are are a hit a miss,1
must admit that new mx master mechanical keyboard looks and sounds great thinking of getting myself one of them now,1
this man really does love gundam respect,1
man the grid studios is my favorite tech that is definitely something to get i got it on my christmas list this year i like the remarkable until i see the price tag thats the remarkable part they can get away with selling it for prices that rival apple products,1
jay had whole lotta energy on this video ,1
as per usual your unboxing videos make me happy actually all of them thanks again,1
thank you for the amazon voucher great content as always,1
hey by popular demand i made a list of all cool tech under 50 products from the last 3 years archived so you can see it all on 1 page,1
my favorite product was definitely the wireless desk charger hope i can finally win one of these love your videos frank keep up the great work,1
on the wireless phone charger i could see installing it under the wood in your nightstands if you have the right kind of furniture for the job also the echo dot stand is super cute definitely made me think of portal turrets too definitely my favorite,1
loved the “invisible” charger would definitely contribute to keeping my clean,1
wow that wireless desk charger is insanely cool i would love one of those,1
this channel is actually really cool instead of being just a kickstarter compilation these are all actual product reviews going to watch a few more before subscribing but so far extremely good channel,1
this might be the best episode of this series ever so many great ideas,1
the charger was my favorite the hidden feature is cool but what i really like is the easy under the desk installation that also saves space,1
what an awesome video i love to see new affordable products come out this makes me wonder why certain tech devices have such an immense shelf price if more technology can be produced at cheaper costs there may be some advancement in the asking price from many everydayused devices such as laptops or desktops,1
i love wireless setups and the wireless charger is always a bonus thanks for the best content as always,1
oh imagine when they get those sound wave extinguishers in giant sizes to catch the forest fires real quick the people animals and homes saved would be amazing not to mention the forests as well what a brilliant invention ,1
imagine we could just buy a sized sheet of film like a screen protector then place it on any window or surface we like such as a mirror bench top or car windscreen and then be able to utilise it like a touch screen  would be more practical than buying an expensive mirror,1
it’s awesome but what happens to the humans that used to do these jobs,1
i can confirm her squirrel facts i raised an orphaned one and it was the sweetest cuddliest pet until it almost grown woke up one morning an she acted like a wild animal biting scratching trying to eat my face off it was a sad day but ive checked wanting a squirrel off my list,0
adore the collection of people you have answering questions they are so intelligent in their respective subject and superbly passionate love learning more,1
i swear to god every can i have this exotic pet question can just be answered with the words do you know what domestication is and how long it takes,0
declawing cats stop calling it declawing it has nothing to do with the claws as the vet said it is amputating the toes cats have claws if you have a problem with claws dont get a cat,0
thank you for addressing declawing cats and how awful and hurtful it is to the cat,0
i have a cat who was declawed by a previous owner he has so many behavioral issues that are typical of declawed cats he was just at the vet yesterday for litter box issues and the vet brought up the fact that he was declawed declawing inflicts lifelong trauma on the animal,0
this woman was born to be a vet you can just tell shes the 1 of kindergarten girls whos living the dream ,1
exotic animals as pets should be illegal tigers dont belong in farms sugar gliders dont belong in apartments sad to see that this happens still,0
if you decide to brush a cats teeth a fencing mask is highly recommended,1
i had a recent fall at work and because i trained myself how to fall off a bike safely i only had minor bruising on my butt i did a tuck and roll like when i fall off the bike great advise alex and ollie,1
when i got right hooked a few years ago i only had time to think “this is gonna suck” and then proceeded to roll a ways on the pavement fortunately i came away with ‘only’ bruises and road rash nothing got broken and i think in part it was because i didn’t have a chance to put my hands out also glad i was wearing a helmet,1
askgcntech after two years of running tubes i finally went tubeless a couple of months ago i managed to puncture my tyre the other day sealant didn’t do the trick nor did a couple of slugs even tried a patch inside the tyre the puncture was not on the sidewall and may have been 3mm large given the tire had plenty of life left i am gutted that i may have to discard the tire now when would you come to a decision that a tubeless tire is ko,0
my last crash 3 yrs ago i was on the ground so fast i had no time to react or prepare for the impact but the scar from my collar bone repair looks pretty cool,1
another problem with filling tires with water is that the first bump you hit will probably cause the tire to blow off the rim water is incompressible unlike air so it has to go somewhere when the tire volume gets changed due to an impact,0
askgcntech as a heavier rider i feel i’m always in the max range of gears either hardest gear on flat’sh roads or my easiest gear when i see any sustained gradients i currently run a compact chain set with a 1230 cassette on the rear would i benefit from upping my chain set to give me more usable gears or would this just make my climbing problem even worse due to the worse range at the rear,0
i bought an old tractor to help clear the land i was building on stick with me i was towing a large log when i felt the back of my leg getting wet no problem on the front of my trousers thank goodness turned out that a large sick had punctured one of the rear tires tyres apparently it was fairly common practice to half fill the rear tyres tires with water to improve traction due to the added weight maybe sealant would be a better idea expensive though love the show guys,1
having shot canon for 20 years i switched the nikon in 2016 love both brands but prefered the nikon ergonomics with the dual command dials rather than the canon methodology of the 4 buttons on the top plate r5 really improved that but i love the isoless nature of the nikon sensors canon is getting better in that regard but still behind nikon and sony,1
hey marques i know these sound insignificant but since you rarely update your little donglesaccessories that you carry around and your apps on your home screens i think it would be interesting to get a little maybe quarterly series where you talk about any changes and what youd like to see changedsimplified with those work flows just an idea,1
mkbhd im a photographer and use the peak edc v2 im impressed you got a 16 into the 20l im sure its a snug fit and doesnt leave alot of room for a ipad too wanted to give you a little tip i found on that bag here goes the main compartment has a pass through to the top zip area where phones airpods etc go you just have to fish a cable through the corner i do this by unzipping the side compartment enough to fish through the cable it makes it so i can leave a pass through usb travel battery charger with folding prongs that means i plug in all my devices when theyre in the zip area laptop phone tablet and airpods and they all get charge from the battery and when i get to the hotel late i just plug one one cable into the wall outlet and i hear all my devices chime in unison that they are now charging neatly in place not only that when theyre done charging the battery starts charging i wake up with everything ready to go hope you enjoy trying this out,1
would love to see an edcdaily tech for everyone else in the studio,1
marquess reaction was genuine here he was excited to know as what will come out of his bag next ,1
i went to check out the opal camera because i need a webcam upgrade and it looked pretty legit i loved everything i saw on the site up until the point of the 4month fee to use their software on a 300 webcam i think ill just get a capture card for my mirrorless or pick up a logi webcam instead other than that nice tech kit also yeah your experience with the pixel 6 mirrors my past experience with pixel phones i got one to try something different to the iphone and i loved it for a few months i tried a few customizations but found that leaving it stock was generally the best experience for me then it started unexpectedly slowing down or apps would wig out and crash on me out of nowhere or the camera just wouldnt or it would reboot in the middle of doing something,1
you are carrying great tech and it makes total sense that you are rellying more and more on apple their ecosystem is really good i am an android user and dont stick to just one brand but my wife is allapple and she really likes how seemless everything is cool stuff marques,1
hey marques can you do an updated “the ecosystem explained” i think a lot of viewers would appreciate a video not only for apple side of the ecosystem but also android seeing as though a lot of new products are coming out in support for easy use for androids love all your videos btw ,1
i can see that exoskeleton helping people with limited mobility in the future its a marvelous piece of tech thanks for giving us a glimpse of things to come,1
the exoskeleton probably wouldn’t be affordable for everyone to use and may have long term effects but i think it would be amazing for rehabilitation and other medical related use,1
ive got that azeron keypad highly recommend it for all kinds of applications where quickness is ideal but especially for gaming highly highly you can even find certain models on amazon usually i ordered mine from the factory for the color scheme and one of the newer designs the one on this video is the original design which im sure is still just as phenomenal but my fingers twitch randomly sometimes so having the buttons above the knuckle could have been a problem,1
the game pad that you highlighted actually is already available i am a right arm amputee and also a big gamer and was considering buying it but it’s over 200 us and you would still need a mouse also i have already become very proficient using a standard controller for gaming already and mostly mostly use an xbox controller for my pc so i decided it wasn’t worth it but it’s still a very good design in my opinion and i would love to see how it feels to use irl just not at that price point lol,1
cyborg game controller looks pretty neat i am from from latvia and that company makes pretty high end gaming gear expensive too,1
i will forever appreciate this channel youve helped me and my family a lot your videos advice lessons and funny words are inspirational and helpful to us my husband and i have been able to minimal conscious in spending saving and investing wisely i now earn every week youre such a blessing to this generation we all love you,1
man to think one day i might be able to own a dehumidifier and a battery wow,1
yes the game pad is incredibly convenient but incredibly expensive so seemingly lower quality production than its competitors that being said i would sure love to have one,1
when someone tells a lie deep down they know this is wrong they have no compassion,0
when you as an employee are fired from a company and the reasons they are giving you are “poor performance or lack of culture fit” trust me when i tell you the real reasons are not disclosed been there done that companies lie hr works for the company and also lies and a corporation hierarchy matters when you lawyer up is when they start taking you a bit more seriously,0
great daily blog you all do a great job picking the most relevant daily headline to cover such a high level discussion in such a short clip i watch or listen every day,1
the market cycle still hasnt met its balance we keep going round in circles while waiting for that huge blow out on a huge support but in the mean time we could always ignore the market ups and downs and stay fully invested big thanks to lily alice for helping me earn over 14 btc by implementing her method and following her guide,1
all the musk haters who said he was doing this for laughs are salty rn,0
thank you for this report well done and very helpful,1
most tech companies let things like this slide all the time…,0
karma hit twitter hard ,0
when it comes to a person journalist slander up and down when it’s a company you say they are allegations,0
“once you spend 5 to 10 grand on magic cards you kinda don’t wanna pay for them anymore” really hits home for me,0
its almost impressive how many ltt employees even with a 5k upgrade have the jankiest setups i have ever seen,1
just a note on the screw driver put some extended bits with it or a smaller precision screw driver in the set with it its very common for some screws to be deep in a hole and having those small bits into hex end wont go in far enough down the hole to extract screw i see this allot on laptops controllers that kinda thing sunk in screws suck,0
ltt extreme tech upgrades will never not be absolutely funny and somewhat informative,1
i think one of the things i love the most about these intel extreme upgrades is linus learning and getting angry at his employees for everything about their lives,1
this episode has me cracking up hard love the rabbit hole that nick has gone down with the keyboard mods respect,1
i love how even linus doesnt want to fit all those hard drives in in a such a jank way im with you linus ill do a lot to make things easier but thats a bit too far xd,1
i love his space its messy full of things that he could throw away if he really went through it all but its a catalog of and container for life as hes living it rather than just a show piece,1
after seeing the macro pad i was checking out their website and loved all their products ive wanted a product like this for when i stream to make it easier and this here is just what i need its a great product and id love it for my setup,1
very surprised with this months list considering how every single item in the list feels like it could go with my setup or just seems super cool to me usually theres one or two items that i dont think id personally find useful but i am 100 adding all these items to my wishlist,1
i absolutely loved the hoto laser measuring tool as an engineering student i am constantly measuring objects and like using various rulers i would love to own one of these hoto laser measuring tools for sure also this months list particularly caught my eye as everything listed seems like something i would want to purchase in the near future,1
so many great products on this list these are all incredibly practical too especially the macropad the abililty to customize literally every aspect of it is killer,1
the hoto laser was a pretty good change of pace loved it feels very complementary to the theme of office gadgets keep em coming ideas specific underdesk drawers and other more “furniture” alike stuff that will make your setup noice,1
just discovered your channel and the series going to be watching your older ones today while working that macro pad is really cool that would definitely be something id pick up and use,1
that macropad looks killer been looking for a segue into custom keyboards for a while and that seems like a great place to start looks like it would be incredibly useful for both work and personal applications too which is a huge plus would love to have one in the near future,1
i’ve actually been looking for macro pads recently and you just upload the very thing i needed i love that you can customize it to fit your aesthetic truly a must have for any setup,1
that macropad looks so  love the customisation of it all,1
arun this product killed over a hundred people also arun 7 out of 10,0
arun this product destroyed the entirety of earth also arun 6 out of 10 fail,0
man i seriously love this series and the fact that you buy these failed products steps thing up a notch,1
great to see you including a wider variety of stuff in these videos beyond just electronic devices especially the pharmaceutical industry if youre going to include banned medications then the top of the list in your next video should be thalidomide what it did was absolutely tragic it was banned decades ago yet people are still suffering and living with severe disabilities to this day thousands of families destroyed and lives lost too,0
this is such a good video arun the amount of research locations and editing that this video needed is enormous thank you for doing this ,1
arun looks so fit now im glad to see him taking care of himself too,1
there was also another problem with the fitbit when some of the straps would irritate your skin and leave a rash and still the company hasnt dealt with it yet,0
1035 this is a common misconception while part of the reason was the battery being too thin the main issue was a manufacturing defect in the corner of most of the batteries at launch which was a tiny dent in the top left corner this would cause the battery to eventually short out as the dent caused both terminals to eventually touch each other most peoples phones were exploding while fast charging which was likely due to the increased power going through the battery and lithiumion batteries do not take well to being shorted out like that edit normally defects of that scale would be perfectly fine and would never cause issues but they made the battery too thin meaning it shorted it out easier just wanted to clarify that,0
i now know i like this guy i at first thought i had some type of prejudicial dislike of him maybe because he was too smooth and that goes against my grain but i love this guy because he does seem to care about things and many of them seem not to be regarding how much money he can make off of a ad for a person it seems as his reviews are sincere and these seem not to have to do with what ive seen only from him which is technology i really love the fact that this guy cares about peoples safety and he brings up some safety issues which people should be concerned about if they have children especially with the toys and the baby monitors yeah this guy is getting a big a from me,1
im hoping this video will blow you away so much work has gone into it and so many people have been fed because of it  to check out the tiniest tech,1
i really appreciate this shaq episode and the effort that went into making it normal looking things scaled up seems much like mrbeast kinda thing think u got inspired by him i have seen the giant toblerone before in sorted the incredible cooking channel has shown the chocolate bar in their occasion based pretentious product series it cost may be 70 poundsbut what u showed is probably bigger than sorted oneits actually cool and it is my favourite chocolate bar too,1
those earbuds are actually pretty cool decorate it somewhere good and it’d act like good speakers,1
i actually have a mousemat that came with my desk thats larger than the one you have its specifically designed to cover the entire surface of the 55 inch desk since its a desk built for gaming,1
wow i never seen technology that big before,1
i have so much respect for you feeding the homeless with the cake,1
if gaiman decides to start a youtube channel to talk about myths and history i would definitely watch that,1
i know this isnt entirely uncommon with authors but ive always loved how much neil gaiman feels like a neil gaiman character,1
you know it’s gonna be great when he says “unless it’s a furry minotaur” and then specified that this is going to be great,1
its nice to see mr gaiman talk about death as being kind his friend and occasional coauthor terry pratchett wrote about death in the same way,1
i love hearing neil speak and explain things he’s such a character ,1
i have been in love with mr gaiman for decades and i couldnt click on this video fast enough major thanks to wired for this video and major thanks to mr gaiman for doing this for all us fans who cant get enough of him,1
i love how he sings his words ragnarok essennntially beginnnnnnns with everything going wrong,1
you can tell hes serious about his craft but not obnoxious about it the best you can hope for,1
hes really respectful of people enjoying sushi differently class act,1
nothing should look sad it should look bright good to know when the aliens come down looking for human sashimi they wont be coming after me,1
you can tell he smiles all the time he just has a happy atmosphere,1
i love how positive this guy is never says a bad word about anyone made me feel like im not stupid even when hes dispelling my wildly inaccurate preconceptions,1
as long as people understand that this is not traditional chefs have the creative freedom to do whatever they want pitty so many prefer to gatekeep stuff and belittle others who merely do things differently respect to taka sakaeda what a lovely person,1
i am so glad i got to see a sushi chef refer to sushi as finger food i am tired of the snobs looking at me weird every time i decide to just pick up a piece and eat it,1
really appreciate you taking the time and effort of putting it out there look forward to watching more of your great content in the past two years assets like gold 7 nasdaq 19 and sp 29 have all lagged behind the usd monetary inflation rate m2 money supply is up 36 while bitcoin has appreciated 229 during the same period my stock portfolio over the last 2 years is massively down against my bitcoin using thomas fuller strategy in my view bitcoin has been one of the best holds during this uncertain market my bitcoin portfolio have been on a rise although the rates are capricious wiping out some of my profits i still have about 914 btc worth of crypto assets i can take a drop down to 20k and still be doing better than my stock portfolio ive stopped buying most stocks im dcaing into bitcoin and im hoarding cash that will go entirely into bitcoin if theres another good drop,1
the record ill love to break is becoming the first millionaire in my family history ive read about people coming from the dirt to making over 2millions in few years and id love to know how to build wealth and amass good profit against all odds,1
last week they said to sell it all now they say buy glad i never listen to these frauds,0
can definitely vouch for the switch grip i used to never play handheld mode because of how uncomfortable it was now i do it all the time with the grip,1
dude that battery swap alone would sell me over the sony h9 steelseries hit it hard with that feature i wish more peripherals had that ability,1
its a great month for tech with a lot of cool and reliable products love em all,1
i gotta admit that steelseries headset is next level also the switch grip being under 20 is a steal,1
the oivo grip is amazing have one for my v2 switch as well,1
the music in the background is just a classic for this channel love it,1
best part about the novas is being able to use the switch with it since it has bt i go from pc play some ps5 then go off the grid with the switch all on one headset it’s amazing,1
when we moved to home working i got the logitech mx master 3 it’s been great as an all round mouse i miss my setup when i have to go back i to the office lol although i could just take my mouse with me,1
i love this series the experts are not judgemental and very professional,1
for those who are curious not only is it widely accepted that an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs but we also know exactly where the asteroid landed its called the chicxulub crater its located on the northern coast of the yucatan peninsula and has been carbondated to have formed in that time period and it size of the crater certainly looks catastrophic enough,0
such innocence when he reads “godstiddies” he is adorable,1
i would absolutely love to attend a paleontology course that guy was running his enthusiasm is infectious,1
the way he factually states the world is a sphere makes you feel like hes heard even weirder statements before and this is just another misconception he corrects ,0
since when were pterodactyls not dinosaurs since ever that is probably one of the greatest answers,1
hearing this guy stay professional while reading the username godstiddies was the highlight of my day,1
that was cool i like that he said jurassic park was for entertainment not science i often hear people complaining that things like jurassic park arent scientifically accurate who cares i watch that kind of stuff to be entertained if i want to learn something ill watch a documentary which i also do,1
the fact that birds are technically dinosaurs is a fact that would have blown my mind as a kid which is why i try to bring it up with kids as often as i can growing up plesiosaurus was my favorite “dinosaur” although it’s technically not a dinosaur my other favorites are maiasaura and parasaurolophus,1
you can always tell when someone enjoys their job he is so enthusiastic and knowledgeable about dinosaurs what a great series,1
the biggest problem is colleges charging outrages tuition fees causing this to happen,0
so everyone who couldn’t afford college will have to pay for those who did……why not make college affordable in the first place,0
now we need to cap these institutions no more predatory pricing honestly these collegesuniversities should be paying back people the interest as well those who have and have not paid off their loans last 30 years included,0
regulate college tuition so that this doesn’t happen again please otherwise this will be pointless,0
when colleges knew about this watch them charge more tuition then you will know why college is expensive in the first place,0
he needs to find a way to get schools to lower their tuition rates and quit trying to game a broken student loan system this will just keep happening and its not going to stop idealistic young people from taking out massive debt on a useless degree the schools need to be regulated if they take govt funds then they should be subject to immediate regulation,0
the states deregulated tuition and fees so the colleges could charge more then they used that money to hire more administrators and build more buildings the students are not just paying for their education they are also paying for all the things the colleges wanted but the states did not want to give them money for nobody talks about that,0
there is no such thing as loan cancellation its merely a transfer do people not understand how this works,0
im trying to hold onto hope and positivity for new york state but every year it gets harder and harder,0
nadler shouldnt be allowed to drive much less wield power,0
funny how democrats always choose the old white man lol,0
a population of mass psychosis,0
nyof course dems did well,1
it never matter how win the question is is the state is any better under either politicians all politicians are very corrupt,0
ny democrats never cease to amaze me…picking the absolute worst representatives possible thanks jim eagle,0
i feel for civilians that just want to live a peaceful normal life in ukraine,0
to be clear its not alleged war crimes they have tried and convicted people for them already so yes war crimes are being committed in ukraine just because you dont like saying it doesnt change that its actually happening to the people it affects,0
i whole heartedly agree with the guy from nato who was saying that europe and the us will pay a high price this winter for supporting ukraine this winter but not supporting them will cost us even more the biggest threat to ukraine right now is that the rest of us will lose interest and abandon them ukraine needs to get all their territory back or russia is just going to eat them in bites and then they will move to the next nation that they want to add back to the soviet union,0
happy independence day to ukraine and glory  the reason why i support ukraine because i’m human and i support human rights and if ukraine surrenders there will be no more ukraine and it won’t save lives it will only end up in a brutal occupation like bucha irpin and mariupol massacre the main goal of russia is that they want to destroy ukraine as a nation just like rome destroyed carthage russians don’t treat ukrainians as people,0
putin is the greatest gift to nato since the end of the cold war now thats funny,1
happy independence day ukrainian people,1
what an excellent piece very good questions and thoughtful answers definitive predictions of course not events in war are hard to predict thank you for a very useful piece,1
thank you very much for your analytical comments and predictions on the war in the ucraine as such more vital weapons supply nato expanding with finland and sweden to face putins war agression and threats and moral worldwide support growing for a democratic and free ucraine as it can daily be seen,1
do you remember what happens when we give unaccounted money and weapons to countries to fight proxy wars we keep making the same mistakes over and over,0
“victory is assured…if we receive 100000000000 this time”,1
notice how the guy calling in keeps saying we in regards to ukraine weird,0
glory to our knights in shining armour the sword and shield of democracy ukraine,1
our government should be held accountable for the pointless expense on this war they already have genocidal turkey helping them and they will still lose at the end all this money could have gone to peoplegovernment took 6 months with vacations to send us measly dimes during covidbut billions they send at a whim,0
i hate to say it but i don’t think the ukrainians are going to be able to counter attack remember ukraine uses 5000 artillery shells a day russia on the other hand is using 500000 shells a day russia has the most tanks in world there isn’t a shortage of there wasn’t a shortage then how come luhansk has fallen let’s not get ahold of ourselves,0
saddakur incoming when he can’t deliver the sheer overconfidence they project as underdogs is off putting not in touch with reality,0
russia is being beaten at highspeed attrition warfare it is alarming how russia is throwing away its best lives and equipment  victory to ukraine ,0
always remember this you cant operate an army without supply trucks also fuel trucks destroy or capture all russian trucks 1 are they armored no 2 do they have heavy weapons on them no 3 is a army truck driver a high skilled soldier no 4 puncture truck tires or damage the engines,0
happy independence day ukrainians,1
to be good at something you got to be doing it all the time why do you think the americans are so good at war,0
happy independence day to ukraine and glory  the reason why i support ukraine because i’m human and i support human rights and if ukraine surrenders there will be no more ukraine and it won’t save lives it will only end up in a brutal occupation like bucha irpin and mariupol massacre the main goal of russia is that they want to destroy ukraine as a nation just like rome destroyed carthage russians don’t treat ukrainians as people,0
as a former combat planner in vietnam i agree with general hodges putins attrition strategy is not well thought out firstly they dont have the right equipment manpower or time ukraine has all of that except for equipment in sufficient quantities over time the wests resources will help ukraine fill that gap,0
europe is forever in debt for the bravery of ukraine hopefully russia shall pay to rebuild ukraina slava,0
i feel like i’m in a simulation at this point,0
i got 25 seconds in and already call bullsht i paused the video to comment but started reading other comments i was amazed because every comment shows disdain for our media including cbs news smh caused me to forget my original and now meaningless thought,0
i am so ready for the future together in faith expose the documents 818 ,1
is he just hiding documents in doughnut boxes im so confused,0
being a politician should not be a career choice term limits for everyone,0
seeing young kids behind him cheering is just insane,1
term limits is a must tired of these crooked cryptic politicians retire,0
i love how new yorkers put pride over common sense as if there were anything to be proud of they deserve exactly all the things are going through,1
wow you would think new yorkers would learn incredible,1
whats shocking is how many people like this guy pretty disgusting,0
hes more detached from the people he represents then any representative in us history,0
all of this does nothing to correct the problem of high college tuition schools will continue to leverage off government loans and at the same time increase tuition to pay for their exorbitant pensions the cycle continues,0
i didnt realize up to 250k per family is consider low income people making way less than that will be paying for his forgiveness plan this administration is insane,0
everyone knows money doesnt mean anything anymore unless you have some the govt can take,0
i’ll believe it when i see my credit report,1
yes perfect i took out loans just in case he would cancel i could have paid for school but i invested it instead best decision,1
as far as the weather this is absolutely crazy what is going on my deepest thoughts and prayers are with everyone across the globe who is in a danger zone and experiencing such hardships,0
thoughts and prayers to all of usa in waters stay safe from the typhoon belt in the pacific las islas filipinas,1
i dont care how many cops there they are not going in to protect ussoooo sad,0
it’s either floods droughts or wildfires actually it’s all of them simultaneously 2030 years from now we might actually start to think seriously about reducing emissions but i doubt it,0
thank you nbc more americans get their news now from nbc then any other source believe that,1
love the pilots to the rescue story great job folks,1
which means the taxpayers will have to foot the bill,0
going to be a lot of people upset when they realize what this does to the economy,0
biden “hey i can help you lose 5 pounds in 5 second without exercise” take out machete and cuts right arm off biden “there you’re welcome dont forget to vote for me in november”,1
so people who paid their debt off just as people who immigrated to usa legally are slapped in the face by people who cannot or will not pay their debt,0
forgiveness means the debt goes away never to be seen nor heard of again this is robbing peter to pay paul,0
this administration is starting to remind me of a time in history called the taxation without representation taxes taxes taxes biden and harris,0
thats so weird hes been screaming he wanted transparency the whole time and now he doesnt want anybody to look at the documents he stole,0
first the documents weren’t there then the documents were planted and now he wants to ban them what a joke,0
simple as this these documents do not belong to him and never did demanding they be returned when they shouldn’t have been in his home in the first place is ludicrous,0
trumps a modern day obstructionist especially about things and issues that can convict him,0
so first he never had it then the cult cried “planted documents” now he did have it but thinks it’s his………you can’t make this stuff upindict indict indict and indict ,0
this video is not for children its shocking alltimeml mr dunn respect to you,0
one asinine move after another from the trump team concerning the searchandseizure i guess trump didnt get the memo that he no longer has enablers in congress or at the doj to bail him out,0
how can reporting on this be so bad the president has the authority to declassified documents not a single one of those documents is classified… do better,0
only trump would call a search warrant unwarranted,0
these people spending all this time and money to try to find dirt on trump is getting old,0
allegedly they say this to avoid being sued learn how words work,0
if he was up to something he would have declassified them when he had the power this is as stupid as the ones getting tickled about this raid,0
they really just dont want him to rerun for presidencyhes not in the club,0
here’s one for ya… if they were so important and they did know about this since he left office… why wait 1 12 years to get the warrant especially in an election year mind blown stop being sheep,0
cosatu is trying to manipulate the people of south africacyril said before the prices rosehe said he discussed that with stake holders and labour unionswhy cosatu and saftu are marching now does this means they are not satisfied with the cost of living or they want to see how many south africans reacts,0
shluggishness to start the protest that could be a problem in our work environment as well lets try to be more in time for work and work with greater vigour to make this a nicer country to live in,0
every year during the month of june and august they is a reason for people to lose jobs these unions are getting paid for this disorder,0
i thought foreigners are the ones earning below ,0
but all of you are the same people that wanted a new south africa why you complaining when you got a new south africa,0
nelspruit strikeshutdown in july was much better n radical,1
when u are unhappy with the current situation u dont further destroy whats left of the economy but u can cut ties with the anc and put your hat in the ring in 2024 its as simple as that,0
our legal system is broken loopholes exist that allow the wealthy to avoid the sort of jail time that would have been inflicted on someone who cant afford elite lawyer representation i get sick of it but im not sure what a challenge to the status quo would look like,0
how long will we allow this clown to continue thses charade its embarrassing to the nation and democracy no one else would even come close to being tolerated,0
it is impossible to simply walk off with these documents and keep them in order to do that you have to purposely want to take them away i cant understand it mick mulvaney,0
first he wanted it out now he don’t so typical of him,0
our greatest concern is that biden remains in office for another five minutes,0
we defeated the wrong enemy now they are destroying us from within,0
if you still vote for brandon after all this you’re beyond trying to reason with,0
we are very confident biden will look into the situation as soon as he gets back from vacation,1
it is a shame that ben has to go behind joe and clean up his terrible policies,0
if you say this is the worst choice you can imagine its guaranteed that thats exactly what this administration will do,0
“leave them alone” i absolutely agree another example of the federal government f ing things up,0
if its a dangerous threat to americans and a bad deal you can be sure biden will agree to it,0
yes the airlines should pay for hotels food transportation from and to airports full refunds they make billions on all if us and we get to sleep in the airports floors  yes make them all responsible for their mess ups,0
airlines need to stop taking money for services they cannot render,0
very glad awp was requested to come help jared and doug are a registered charity and rely on donations and support to help families for free they take their efforts very seriously now after two years and 23 solved cases they offer training to local police expanded to two teams with a dive master and training ozark adventures to create a third hope they stay safe and their dedication pays off to provide answers to the family,1
“there’s no way to enter a serial number and search for the owner” how are we ever supposed to stop gun violence with a stupid law like that,0
i was just one of the persons that asked for adventures with purpose to come in and help i have watched this team for a long while now they are the very best i wish them safety and hope im praying this young lady is found soon best of luck to these men if she is in the water they will find her,1
sorry for the 16 year old my child at 16 yrs could not be out partying at 12 midnight no way no how hate me now love me later,0
just knowing that first responders took pictures and shared them with friends would cause me major distress just because they werent on social media doesnt mean the public didnt see them i hope she wins big and they are forced into reprimanding the staff along with making policy changes,0
kudos to the ukrainian freedom orchestraits quite refreshing to see this side of ukraine continue to fight with your instruments for your culturewe do appreciate every one of you stay strong,1
if you are watching this i wish you the best with everything that you do i wish you the best with everything you go through ,1
the market has been pretty bad until today it decided to surge everybody was practically crying then it kept dipping thats what you get when you feel you can navigate the process on your own big thank to hilder ferguson im not bothered with how bad the market is because my assests are insured due to her advice and i still receive my profits,0
not only on the wrong track but off the rails chuck,0
conveniently leaving out voters opinions on the media by far the worst of the institutions,0
why would they be angry they voted for it,0
if you read barbara walters how civil wars start you would know that there are two issues that lead to violence anocracy and factionalization democracies dont fight nor do authoritarian states its the transition from one system to the other where the hazards are found thats anoncracy factions in the book means when people sort themselves by ethnic or sectarian attributes rather than policy preferences and this sorting creeps into their entire lives weve been on that course since the tea party started the only cure is doubling down on democratic participation the gop is pointedly not doing that anywhere theyve got their hands on the controls we are being steered right for the ditch so im glad at least one in five of us say thats the 1 problem we face,0
wage slavery during the apocalypse polls poorly who would have guessed,0
21 making  74 struggling,0
most important issue too much money in politics we desperately need campaign finance reform,0
do a poll to see who is responsible for all of this one single man with only his own personal interest has done all of this,0
who does not have any principle is nitish,0
wtf ak47,0
good luck sri lanka team win the match ,1
this gives hope to all malaysian citizensjustice is prevail,1
it’s really unfortunate that the intended target was missed,0
rip to the toyota lancruiser also killed in the bombing it would have reach a retiring million km mark with proper motor oil transmission oil and gear cases maintenance it will be missed by the local dealership mechanic,0
i feel so bad for the victim of that bombing my heart goes out to the car,0
sucks to suck dugin unfortunate a car was destroyed in the process,0
slava ukraini i really hope that mr dugin knows what the pain is when losing your shared ones like all the parents in ukraine who lost daughters sons babiesmom and dad during that sad war,0
the ignorance of the people vilifying someone who tragically was assassinated is asinine also doesnt help when you realize that russia is using her death as a franz ferdinand moment so yeah keep vilifying til your world ends not a threat an analyzation with this russia wont stop til ukraine falls,0
i’m dead serious about this he switched cars at the last second now why would he do that felt his safety was in danger something doesn’t add up about all this,0
i feel bad for the daughter not for the father,0
the case was brought to federal court only to have another year of freedom his side clearly had no proper counter arguments from the start pity the court of having to deal with this drama,0
my salute to the judges they are not swayed by threats accusations against them justice is served,1
this is the real meaning of merdekafor rakyat,1
imagine a prime minister this corrupted can you think of the people in his circle,0
fair and transparent trial and appeal despite vile attempts to delay and frustrate justice,0
the best day of my life the best news ever whatever goes around comes around justice prevailed thank god,1
there is hope for our nation thank you to the prosecution and judiacry,1
this year merdeka is probably one of the most memorable ones after najibs final verdict the judges are our last straw of hope to bring corruptors behind the bars,1
the court had done its job now the rakyats turn if bn wins the next pru itll likely be that they ask for royal pardon to free him itll be difficult to know if agong will grant it seeing this is a serious crime of trustworthiness and integrity we do not know its our job to make sure bn has no such opportunity,0
thank god for the people who called it in and the officers who responded,1
great job to everyone that was aware and made a call to action you helped save lives unfortunately this is becoming the normal but if we are alert and step in we can avoid a tragedy,1
shows what a tremendous difference we can make by being alert and notifying the authorities when suspicious better to be safe than sorry the police aren’t able to do this on their own without us all being aware and responsible citizens massive thank you to all those involved especially those who did chose to speak up ,1
i’m grateful that someone was paying attention and called it in and everyone is safe i’m sad for the young lady though who feels like it was the only place she could go to feel accepted i hope she can find some peace and friendship in a more permanent way,1
my friends were there last night fucking props to those that called it in,0
excellent job to the grant county sheriffs office and to the people attending the concert who kept an eye out and reported it,1
this is terrifying a couple days ago i was just talking to my friend who went to a music festival where the security didnt even check bags she was kinda scared how an event like that could easily be the target of mass shooting,0
so sorry about mr engles son condolences to the family,0
dear richard engel and his wife my sincere condolences on your loss your pain cannot be imagined but your bravery and courage in sharing your sons struggles is felt and now his legacy may hold a cure down the road for other families so they will never have to endure your heartbreak sending you blessings and hugs please stay safe and strong,1
ill be so glad when the whole trump drama is over 5 years of a bad play is too much for any audience member to endure,0
two of the most important jobs are sadly also the most underappreciated teachers and nurses deserve so much more more money more respect more support,1
so sorry for richard and his family i hope they find the strength they need to go through this process,0
my condolences to richard and his family he is a great journalist,1
when money plays out those millionaires have many ways to evade prosecution but when poor people get in trouble they are doomed,0
rest in peace henry and fly high with the angels  ,1
i heart goes out to richard engel i am literally crying my eyes out right now and yes i’m a man it is so sad for our own richard to lose his son i’m so sorry for your lost richard i hope you take some time off and be with your family god bless you and your family ,0
airlines intentionally mislead customers it’s discussing they got a high amount of money from the government and now they over books all flights,0
thank you pete planning a trip and missing a wedding or a funeral no excuse for over selling every flight they need to factor weather in the schedule,0
my condolence to richard and family,1
investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list in some months time youll be ecstatic with the decision you made today,1
i worried because my grass is dead wow you arent ready for this world lady,0
all wars are terrible but honourable in defence of ones country slava ukraine,0
you’re in the middle of a ground invasionoccupation of a neighboring country and don’t feel even a little ridiculous complaining that someone ruined your navy parade ,0
proud of my ukrainian blood even more proud of the strength of cousins ive never met im with you in mind and spirit ,1
glory to ukraine  from  the brave stand against evil,1
as a romanian im eagerly awaiting to vacation in friendly sovereign and free ukrainian crimea slava ukraini,1
ukraine amazing people amazing army cant wait to visit this country once its liberated,1
how dare they defend themselves after being invaded whats the world coming too ,0

the cdc was only partly to blame our forprofit healthcare system also failed us as iit does every day,0
lester you are the only news i listen to these days it is such a relief to have one outlet to hear the current news reported in a neutral factual way everywhere else there is no reporting just drama and opinions about current events thank you thank you thank you,1
in a heartbeat ill vote for her,1
interesting news coverage and very informative definitely things to know about,1
cdc couldve responded whatever way they wanted but as we all saw during the pandemic too many people would have simply not cared heck it was too much for them to even wear a mask,0
what a great story by a honorable and honest man i believe himand am also someone who has had contact much love and peace to all,1
didn’t need the cdc to make that announcement we knew they didn’t do their job,0
a country is not great until it can protect all its people with free healthcare is pence feeling the heat getting closer sorry about cheney wyoming got its priority really wrong,0
liz liz displays common sense and a desire to do the right thing,1

it was a beautiful car explosion a perfect car explosion people tell me theyve never seen such as perfect car explosion,1
someone wanted to take him out but ended up hurting him one million times more,0
it hurt ha now the father can feel the pain he likes to influenced,0
he has lost what is most precious to himself his no claims bonus,0
well he now knows how the families of the victims of the novichok attack feel in britain,0
he’ll probably blame everyone else but himself after immersing himself in hatred he will probably be genuinely perplexed as to why anybody might want to kill them,0
instant karma feel the pain of many ukrainian fathers who have lost their sons and daughters in ukraine this is much painful than being assassinated,0
the fear he and others with him will suffer every time he gets into a car now,0
its tragic that someone loses their life like that but dont forget that one violence is the cause of another violence the young womans father propagated violence and now it came back to him with violence against his family use your brain violence is always the worst option,0
prayers that everyone in their family get to dry ground and stay safe but also this is a blessing so many of these areas really needed this water,1
hope the person missing in zion national park is found safehopefully they were able to get to higher ground,1
itll never hit home till it actually hits home for some people,0
the rain is greatly needed in some areas but i want folks to be safe also ,1
the potential tropical storm passed thru here in merida yucatan a couple days ago was pretty fierce our strongest storm of the 2022 rainy season definitely needed to place objects that can become airborne in a safe place hopefully monterrey will get the much needed rains theyve been praying for,1
wowat same time i had flooding inside my house in caribbean pushing flood water out my mind went on gratitude that others have it worse not knowing same occuring simultaneously i hope all recover quickly,0
when the land is hit by heat waves and dries water usually cant get in and thats a recipe for floods when it rains,0
this is what happens when we continue to neglect the environment when our lakes are drying up the only way to stop future tragedies like this is to get on top of our climate issues,0
yes my fellow texans stay alert because if anything happens we are on our own abbott will likely spend 5 mins blaming the windmills then go back to his cocktail party while millions go without drinking water,0

that boy and girl just at the end of the report theyre so happy in spite of the invasion of their country those two are great ,1
we need more britt coverage ,1
6 monthsand at times we had to be reminded a war was going on,0
rumi a 13th century persian philosophers view on wars wars like childrens fights are meaningless pitiless and contemptible,0
have you considered why somehow the war should not be taken onto russian territory or russians should be in any way immune from the horrors of the war of conquest that russians have started the trillions in damage the russians have done to ukraine in terms of infrastructure and lost economic output the 10s of thousands of people theyve killed the millions of people theyve displaced,0
if you can’t sleep at night just listen to joe biden you will go to bed within minutes no need to buy an app ,1
but its okay to invade ukraine but once russia is getting attacked its a crime,0
wars are worst things in life and sadly we keep continuing same mistakes because of bloody old politicians who thirst for wars for their interests and leave people die all governments are involved in world and no one is innocent imagine no wars everywhere and peace but that is impossible because evils surround us,0
the problem with this that by focusing on totally different thing rather than better content we subscribers are paying the price with increasing subscription fee,0
netflix in a lot of trouble now especially as more market competition comes in from other distributors this move into gaming will not do them any favours,0
the reason netflix is struggling is because they keep losing content their own content when its good is constantly neglected and they keep raising the price without adding commensurate value to justify it getting into games demonstrates that they are not recognizing what theyre doing wrong and simply trying to find a new source of revenue instead of fixing their faults people are getting sick of having the price increased while more and more good content disappears or takes far too long to update people are used to getting the next season of a series once every year but many of them are taking 2 to 3 years to release even before covid,0
when i first got into watching netflix there were a lot of low budget but very original and interesting documentaries and tv series on it however in recent times i feel like a lot of the diversity in the platform has gone,1
this is the problem with these big companies their core offering starts to fail and they think moving focus elsewhere is the answer instead of making sure their core offering is decent,0
i worked in retail for most of my life and the one thing i have never forgotten is the fact that once you lose a customer you are going to play hell trying to get them back regardless of what you do,0
i think it’s so silly that netflix feels the need to compete with youtube and tiktok i think these platforms should be able to exist together in harmony as they each offer very different products eg people can follow along with reactionsreviews and video essays while watching a netflix series people also don’t typically like when youtubers are given a large budget like with youtube red originals so netflix buying out certain youtubers is not the right idea…,0
honestly maybe it would have made more sense to commission more games based on their original ips yeah it takes longer to come out but you’ll get better quality and hopefully better return on investment,1
i think this is gonna take netflix back to its feets it just needs more perseverance and the ability to be positive minded,1
linus just turn the key lights 180 and bounce them off the walls you’ll get a much softer glow and shadow and way more even lighting it’s such a simple fix i’m not sure where along the lines people got the idea to beam the lights directly at your face ,1
dan continues to be my new favorite he has such an air of confidence about him and a comforting presence like dan shows up and you just know things are going to be fine,1
dan managing to set up his soldering station on the one box they needed was incredibly amusing to me,1
linus gets on his employees cases for all the stuff stolen from the office also linus proudly talks about all the stuff stolen from work hes using in his upgraded setup linus why are you using this monitor as a table also linus uses the monitor as a chair this video was hilarious,1
dan the man saving the day riley needs to give him his own theme like brian the electrician,1
dan continues to be a favourite for me hes like the incredibly patient but longsuffering dad who just gets on with things,1
dan is a treasure your channel has long lacked a mr fixit type and while i am sad its not me dan appears quite capable and funny,1
blows my mind how quickly dan became the rock upon which all things linus standslove it,1
hey linus a good trick for streaming lights bounce them off the wall much easier on the eyes and a nice softer look also for indoors id recommend a hypercardioid mic looks like a short shotgun like the audiotechnica at4053b,1

im surprised getting all the collectibles didnt even get an honorable mention theres been more than enough people who couldnt 100 the arkham games simply because they didnt like the riddler trophy collecting quest especially arkham knight due to how many times you had to use the batmobile just for those collectibles,0
the one that annoyed me was the borderlands 1 when to obtain you had to play online with someone from gearbox or with someone who already had the trophy they changed it for the rerelease to playing with three players at once,0
i always adored ffviii my older brother gifted me with the strategy guide when i first bought it so that may have something to do with it lol that said if youre trying to 100 ffviii on the og north american release good luck a strategy guide will not help you get the ribbon,1
the original infamous hurt my soul i played through the campaign twice on hard to get the platinum only to find out while i was doing cleanup that the stunt master trophy cant be completed post game i had all but one stunt to knock 3 enemies off a roof at once when you clear out an area enemies no longer spawn in large numbers therefore there isnt enough enemies to get the stunt i didnt have it in me to start another campaign the sad part is i had tried the stunt on multiple occasions only for it to glitch and not award the stunt,0
ac3 was super annoying when first released because of having to pass the mission the first time without any retry problem was the controls were clunky af and the goals of the missions most of the time were annoying or without too much logic like do not touch water,0
multiplayer trophies tied to the platinum will always always be the worst,0
so glad you did multiplayer awards lumped with single player awards that is the biggest bullshit for single game players that dont want to listen to children screaming neck beards eating or just racist hateful crap just for a trophy,0
i honestly feel like cod mw on did it best on xbox 360 achievements for single player and challenges for multiplayer that was 2007 now i’m 34 with a wife and kids it’s almost unimaginable trying to do 100 a game with multiplayer supporting a family and working,1
you guys are really getting your moneys worth with the new background music,1

the only unrealistic part is having consistent connection with very little delay because even in this decade big pings and lags is still a common occurences,0
as someone living in the future i can confirm that this is perfectly accurate,1
i remember doing this back in 2000 good times talking about his mother,1
this honestly sounded like a legitimate prediction until the last part xd,1
wow the concept of sending games over the internet lines sounds so compelling i wish online multiplayer was real ,1
impossible nothing like that could ever be made,0
man i love seeing old media predict the future correctly they even showed the lack of joy all gamers have,1
implying that this insult has been passed down for decades quickly we must continue the legacy,0
wow im so excited for the future alongside flying cars 2000 is looking to be rad,1
ilets all appreciate the amount of effort this man puts in his videos amazing keep grinding bro i love the videos,1
let’s take the moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into his for us great job mate,1
the skins just got released and hes the first one who ive seen that have it love this content him and other fortnite youtubers make,1
was not expecting this collab thank you for the daily content you always kill it for us d,1
love the videos and the work you put into it keep it up,1
best man ever his content is always good ,1
keep it up tg love the content,1
the skins just got released and hes the first one who ive seen that have it love this content him and other fortnite youtubers make,1
as a destiny veteran and current destiny 2 tourneys player i think they did pretty good with zavala and the others ikora and exo stranger,1
massive thank you to everyone for checking out the video i went back and forward on making it whether it was too negative or not but very reassuring to know its not just me noticing these things and wanting to talk about them cheers scott,1
i adopted a mindset of delaying my gaming brain by a year if a game comes out in 2022 i wait until 2023 i get it at its cheapest and usually complete i have been doing this with every game i buy for the last 5 years and i have saved so much money while enjoying the games much more,1
i used to preorder games to get the “collectible” toy that was sought after the items got really cheap really fast not worth it they also tell you that there may not be enough copies that never happened there was always enough copies,0
good video these are the kinds of topics and discussions the gaming industry needs to need to be having now publishers developers the media and gamers themselves have to throw one in though for every game with a yearly release i also have to point out games with decade or more release cycle how long between gta 5 and 6 fallout 4 and 5 skyrim and elder scrolls 6,1
i wish developers would realize that forced drm and internet connectivity for games is a step backward look at the debacles gt7 and simcity have endured whats the point of paying a full 70 for the game if there is no guarantee you can play it at your leisure especially if this ridiculous requirement is in place for singleplayer modes in my opinion at that point you cant help but wonder if spending time with the game is either fun or just another full time job this is not why people play games,0
when i think about the games i played the last few years i must say that i almost always enjoyed indie titles alot more than big ips so i rather pay 30€ for an indie title that is really inspiring with fresh new ideas than wasting 60€ on a broken aaa title without any innovations,1
i havent bought a game on release for the past 6 years now the gaming industry has changed for a while now and its only getting worse i buy 34 games per year at most and usually heavily discounted quality multiplayer games are a rarity nowadays cod and battlefield lost their way quality single player games are still a thing but are often filled with bugs on release so i wait it out and buy goty editions usually and often second hand gotta love disc edition systems i refuse to fuel bad descions made by money hungry devs or publishers,0
i tend to stick to games made before 2010 as they give the best value and experience feels like games were made for fun rather then rip off the player,1
this video made me a bit sad made me realise how the industry has changed and not for the better i have young children so can’t game like i used to but when i do have time i find myself increasingly drawn back to older games that i’ve played before but adore the vast majority of new games just don’t appeal to me as for the new gen consoles…what’s the point all they seem to be doing is rereleasing older gen games yawn,0
one of the best thing about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieved something he always regular us the audience his team and he is polite in all his video we congratulatiet ourselves on this achievement more to come,1

very relaxing video it helped me sleep,1
ive been around for every console generation i remember thinking during the genesisturbografx era snes not out quite yet what games would be like when i was old and the kind of specs they would need obviously i had no idea what the specs really meant back then but i was thinking 256bit lol as for the cpu and 64bit is all we really need for that they have happily progressed faster than i had imagined looking just as good today if not better then i imagined things would look like 2025 years from now the 1990s and early 2000s with the massive clock speed increases and the advent of the gpu were the main things that took us to where we are hardware wise,1
we are an architecture and construction company in chile and we have used unreal engine for a long time and it is the best for realtime visualization  the preview versions of unreal 5 were already spectacular and the best thing is the lighting lumion really changed everything its great that this is being talked about not only in games but also in movies and other experiences like ours there are plenty of tutorials to learn  we did it that way out of fear to learn it,1
i actually home every game system dating back to my atari 2600 i never ever thought games would look this good i cant imagine how they will look 20 years from now with how fast technology keeps moving forward,1
im over the moon hyped for the day before i hope it delivers in the hype like elden ring did if thats even possible for developers other than fromsoft,1
most games these days look mind blowing especially when you can remember when gaming pretty much first started with games like pong etc,1
i think we’ve reached the point that these devs need to come up with better idea and aí for decades now they just been able to make games look better a lot of games are actually worse gameplay wise with stale ideas and dumbed down mechanics than older games,0
these games look insane cant wait to play some of them great list by the way,1
im so glad i built a nice high end rtx 3090 pc a year ago its incredible the amount of eye candy 4k gaming treats us with no wonder its the biggest money making entertainment industry on the planet thanks for those awesome little previews nicely presented too much appreciated,1

wow im impressed think theyve set a new bar with that spec and it being a 42,1
this monitor looks really clean with almost no bezels i like how it’s got a tilt adjustable stand as well nice video,1
my favorite part of this tv 42 is basically tv size is the custom heatsink i dont care too much about the size of the back of the monitor as long as it doesnt dim the brightness constantly,1
great video i think ill still be leaning toward the c2 though as the £400 price difference at the moment is too appealing,1
awesome review what are your thoughts on the picture quality compared to the lg c2 42 does the matte coating make a noticeable difference to the picture quality i want to get a new monitor for work and gaming but not sure if i should get the c2 at a cheaper price this or perhaps wait another year for something new,1
oled gaming wow please compare to the c2 you had as a monitor side by side to see that contrast difference uniform brightness difference etc for those comparing the c2 42 and this love your content,1
thanks for the review i cant wait for your full review my dream spec for a gaming monitor would be pretty close to this 42 inches or so antiglare normal aspect ratio not ultra wide but 1440 200mhz instead of 4k because not even a 3090ti will do anywhere near 4k 138mhz in most decent looking aaa titles anyway if possible i had a couple of suggestions for things to look at over the course of your full review what do resolutions other than 4k look like on the monitor try playing a game in 10801440 and seeing what the monitors scaling is like in the settings what hdr options are available thanks,1
hi spawnpoiint im looking forward to the complete review youre the most thorough and thoughtful reviewer ive seen one thing id like to see in the review is a comparison with a matte screen ideally a sidebyside in different conditions to illustrate the pros and cons and help us decide what coating we prefer dont know if thats feasible for you in any case thanks for the work and enjoy,1

gotta love lenovo got the ryzen 5600h version of this laptop with the same 3050 after seeing the positive reviews you guys gave it and i couldnt have been happier it was 700€ in italy at the time paired with my wacom cintiq and a ram upgrade its been the perfect little gaming and digital painting set up,1
people have been going crazy for the gigabyte g5 kd going for a relativelyaffordable price for an i5 11400h and rtx 3060 would be cool to see you guys buy and review it to see how good it is,1
lenovo always been crazy in the budget gaming laptop market my first introduction to pc gaming was a 1080p lenovo with sli 750ms was a killer deal too back when the 7 series was nvidias newest line i remember looking up so many videos about its performance in games weeks before i got it i havent gotten anything lenovo since as i build my own towers now and get much more premium laptops but i will always appreciate and respect what lenovo does,1
nice definitely a great value i still have my old lenovo 960m 4gb gaming laptop i never upgraded it from 8gb of ram and that wouldve been an easy move for more performance now it doesnt make sense as i upgraded to an alienware with a 3080 and 32gb of ram but i still sometimes fire up the lenovo to see what it can do in 2022,1
i just bought this today on best buy for 570 dollars love to see your making a video on it,1
recently bought a lenovo legion laptop for 539 on ebay 4600h 1650 ti 8gb rams and 512ssd never been happier lenovo makes the best bang for the buck laptops also they aren’t to flashy,1
i got an older version of the ideapad gaming 3 with a 1650 but with a ryzen 5600h and a 512gb ssd its an amazing laptop but i bough it at the time last year for 750 not a bargain but a well balanced laptop for work and gaming,1
i have the model from 2019 mine has an i79850h and a mobile gtx 1650 this is a great machine aside from some plastic chipping due to the lid being opened and closed it annoyingly was 1300 with discounts,1
oh boy cant wait to buy it in 2 years when theyre in stock,1
never thought id say this but i got my ps5 today its absolutely breathtaking,1
truly excellent overview concise and informative i genuinely feel better equipped to make my decision regarding the playstation 5 after watching your review appreciate you and your consistently fine work,1
just stumbled upon your channel after successfully ordering a ps5 yesterday through sony direct the anticipation of it getting delivered made me want to watch some unboxings and reviews i came across your channel and immediately clicked because we have the same last name which is neat haha i actually really enjoyed your video it’s informative offers great insight and very professional while maintaining a personal creative nuance thank you,1
i got the controller alone for use on my pc and im shocked that it works so natively well of course none game that i know of uses the trigger gimmick but the soundvibration feedback works like a charm sure it does require some set up but it works,1
i honestly think marques should start a gaming channel only so we can appreciate him enjoying his tech in the way most people will do being very analytical and knowledgeable about tech is a great benefit to those who come to this channel but there is a slight otherworldliness to seeing some talk about tech in a matter of fact way and not seeing them actually use it in a real world environment and showing that they actually enjoy the thing they are criticisingwhich to be fair no one with sense would think he doesnt enjoy his tech but seeing it would be a great addition,1
the controller really is the coolest thing about the ps5 astro’s playroom is insane with the haptics,1
can we take a moment appreciate the level of effort norman put into this video the research facts analysis and narration are top notch i love the visual aspects like magazines figures gone box art and trinkets great job norm,1
being an 80’s baby 90’s kid it just feels like a blessing to have experienced all this first hand,1
this is hands down the best nintendo documentary i have seen in my entire life huge video game fan im 44 now and getting those memories back is awesome along with tones of things i didnt know cheers,1
your documentaries are soooo well written and edited thanks for the great content man,1
i’m in my earlier 40s i’ve found it difficult to go back and still enjoy many of the games from my youth but super mario world still holds up i think it will continue to stand the test of time with the ageless gameplay and level design it’s a masterpiece,1
a fantastic and well made documentary that truly made me feel like a kid again i could feel my 5 year old self anticipating this 16 bit treasure as you were describing the build up to mario worlds launch in america i havent truly felt that way in a long time thank you i think i am going to go play some mario world now,1
first allnighter i had was with a friend playing super mario world will never forget it seeing the artwork in the instructions book that came along brings back so many memories remember how awesome it was when you first discovered the sta rroad the top secret area in the donut ghost house the music in vanilla dome or valley of bowser damn it i wanna play now,1

i love how he randomly used obama as a trigger word ,1

hello asmr gaming news love ur videoskeep it up,1
hi could you try to make a video in french its my language thanks in advance and keep up the good work ps your videos are very relaxing ,1
very relaxing video it helps me sleep and relax,1
the fake slide is unfair to the defense you pursue that and get penalized as a defender,0
for people complaining on the fake slide it was absolutely legal at the time of the play and was a glaringly awful loophole in the rules it was changed as a direct result of that play,0
345 seein bill get all excited like that describing the play… just let’s you know how exciting and high iq ed reed was in his time him and troy are the best safeties i’ve seen in my lifetime by far,1
im not into sports at all but damn i am so amazed at how these guys can act like one mind with a single thought just incredible cooperation,1
polamalu jumping over the line against the titans is extra smart because he knows that even if hes too early its a flag but just half the distance to the goal theyre already so close to the goal line that it doesnt matter,1
in case you’re wondering why the clock didn’t stop at that obj play the rule states that if you aren’t gaining yards while going out of bounds the clock keeps running this is a great example of obj he can’t just catch but he can run throw kick you name it,1
wow what an incredibly well researched video so many great moments and some i havent even seen before only wish you wouldve included when alex smith hid the ball from the refs but great video nonetheless,1
the fact chris paul knew that rule is impressive,1
what a game of football the passion the fights refereeing decisions all of it this is why we love the premier league,1
passion aggression goals assists push n pulls yellow and red cards celebrations and fights this is something us man utd fan wish to see in our team but can only see in other teams epl at its best moments kudos to the two epl contenders great match,1
the volley was great but cucurella’s cross was also a thing of beauty,1
most exciting game of football i’ve seen in a long time it had everything,1
“conte once a chelsea friend now a devoted foe” that was colddddd ,0
what a goal by koulibaly what a crazy game what a handshake ,1
i dont see many commenting on the foul that took havertz down and led to spurs first goal that should have been a card and a free kick it was clearly a foul in the replay no wonder tuchel was so steamed for the rest of the match,0
imagine youre a manchester fan and you here watching this brilliant game,1
i’m a chelsea fan chelsea vs tottenham are always some of my very favorite match days of the season they never ever fail to excite,1
if this is only the 2nd week of the premiere league i cant wait for what the rest of the season brings the beautiful game the passionate game,1
im 46 years old this music rocks my world,1
i literally ran from my house to the forest near the park that’s near my house and started playing this cause today i felt magical ,1
ive been out of high school for 7 years in may its not very often that i hear a newer song and get sent back to the musical equivalent of me in 2013 ive been trying to do some trauma healing using this song and i think ive made some progress slowly but surely i am starting to love myself again after years of just trying to survive wilist hating myself i may not be happy now but im on the road to being there i dont care if nobody sees this i just know im getting better and thats all that matters,1
why do i start crying every time this plays no reason i just do i love this song,1
this music is amazing god my heart stumbled upon them whilst searching guitar videos for lessons now im playing along,1
i was never good at sports sis we all felt that,0
all her music is just so good like i can relate to most of it and the sounds in her music are so sad yet upbeat and happy ive never heard music like hers in my life and i really like it,1
this song is my go to whenever i feel something this song usually helps me go back to feeling empty thanks,1
i heard this song in a store once and it became one of my favorites i finally found it again love your music beach bunny 3,1
great sound and vibe reminds me of mid80s college radio,1
why am i crying  tee tee was running for her dear life because jamaica was on her tail like lightning amazing race athletes performing at the highest level ,1
so proud of these ladies  they beat a jamaican team with 3 of the best sprinters we’ve ever seen absolutely incredible,1
jenna prandini’s leg was crazy she passed one of the greatest ever sprinters and put the usa in the lead wow,1
tee tee teri is such a sweetheart that face brings me to tears every time jamaica was trying to run her down little baby face teetee go girl go,1
beating thompsonherah fraserpryce and jackson in a single race is massive for any team on any stage,1
wow usa 3 of them are rookies amazing beating the jamaican legends prandini is awesome on the curves all 4 did what they had to do to win,1
when i saw melissa jefferson’s reaction during the announcements i immediately knew usa was going to win she looked dialed in,1
shoutout to my american queens yall deserve everything and more,1
this was such an exciting race the jamaicans are so competitive i love it the germans emotions after making the podium was contagious,1
team jesus  comment down below if your on his winning team ,1
hurdleskicks a man is one of the best calls of all time,1
that marion barber back flip though   rip legend ,1
the funniest part about the baez thing is as soon as javy turned around the first baseman could have turned around and stepped on first and ended the inning,1
124 is a smart move shot clock doesnt move until he touches the ball but the game clock does roll,1
 dp tour tickets available now ,1
all you guys bring me happiness and joy to my days when i watch you,1
i know this video has been out a long time but i can’t get enough of dude perfect,1
just saying that ever since cory shaved them eyebrows he has been straight fire in battles,1
3 years later still not done another annual baseball battle but still love the content keep it up ,1
greatest come back ever  although cory deserved to win ,1
coby always deserves a second chance,1
this quickly turned into very possible moments,1
some people are not only incredibly talented they work hard on their skills and perform what seems impossible stephan curry and tiger woods come to mind right away both work incredibly hard in practice and alone as well,1
054 best teammate in the history of the world he jumped off the bench and was cheering way before the ball went in,1
550 that man knows what he just did was impressive as hell he deserves to feel proud for that,1
110 love the inevitable evan longoria clip but right after that is the volleyball player going into the stands to keep the ball alive i’m surprised that they allowed that ,1
i loved that you added volleyball in this compilation more less popular sports need recognition like cricket dodgeball and badminton,1
incredible performances i just loved all the scenes shown just marvelous,1
i swear every half court shot when the time ends is epic,1
an amazing performance definitely maguires best performance in a united shirt,1
maguire needs a standing ovation for staying out of this one my god a real captains performance for sure,1
i’m not a united fan but when i say this game gave me chills it reassured me why i watch the premier league,1
crazy seeing ronaldo on the bench it’s really the beginning of a new era,1
this defense was really solid i can’t wait to see the addition of casemiro with this coaching and this rebuilt defense we’ll do really good this season,1
the fans were there for the players tonight and they didn’t disappoint,1
this game was very emotional for me the way we have played in recent seasons has been frustrating still early but this could be the start of something great,1
i like to see man utd fans happy they’ve been thru a lot they deserve it,1
this is why we love epl even the games between bottom teams are so exciting,1
liked this video make sure to check out the top 100 sports bloopers of the decade,1
i like the clips where someone makes one of the better plays ive seen and the announcer is like that is definitely one of the best plays this weekend ,1
love the variety but the minneapolis miracle in the 90’s while we got regular season mlb in the top 20… cmon man,1
i forget how much i appreciate the other sports i’m a hockey person but wow baseball the nfl wow even soccer when they’re not crying on the field wow what great athletes,1
you know a canadian made this list when a damn curling highlight makes the cut,0
felicidades es un buen ejemplo 250 sentadillas son unos topgirlsuno muchas y un buen ejercicio 525 se deja ver que hay muy buenos resultados  saludos desde la cd de world  los mortales abian apreciado tan hermosa mujer,1
i played on the field for number 31 i was in the australian juniour league world series team and had alot of memories come back to me from looking at the scenery,1
1442 this is the most painful one on this list if you ask me out of all the premature celebrations out there resulting in losses this ones just different the game was over lol its not like someone tripped you up before getting a touchdown the game is literally over all you do is hold onto the ball for a couple seconds and thats it the washington wizards were up by 3 at that point even if the apposing team has time to foul you you hit just 1 free throw and its over even if you miss both they have to somehow rebound the ball and go for a full court shot to tie the game in an impossible amount of time long story short that throw lost them the game after ot lol just look at his fellow teammates staring at him in total disbelief afterwards gotta be one of the worst throws in sports history,0
910 the game was almost over and was a blowout at that point dallas 52 buffalo 17 yet check out don beebe still giving 100 effort after the game bills owner ralph wilson walked from the owners booth to the locker room and thanked beebe for the play,1
being a packers fan i remember watching that game against the seattle seahawks where hassleback said they were going to score in ot and when al harris picked him off and took it back i remember my family and i was jumping up and down yelling and going nuts one of my favorite sports moments ever especially with my favorite team being the ones offering the karma back at hassleback,1
d hop breaking his ankles literally was by far the most savage,0
success is the best revenge my dad used to say and its true,1
pujols and trout taunting with the bow and arrow gestures was priceless,1
440 isnt even the whole story the last time giancarlo stanton faced fiers he hit him in the face ending his season and prompting reconstructive surgery thats the reason he and now many baseball players wear face flaps on their helmets the very next time they face off he hits him again even if unintentional thats nuts,0
this is unreal congrats on doing this at such a special place,1
dude they actually got jim nantz to announce it legendary,1
i was watching this with my dad and he didnt believe they were actually at the masters its crazy great job to the editors the team and bryson big achievement to be able to play at one of the most prestigious places on earth,1
i feel like most people watching this video have 0 idea how unbelievable it is that they were allowed to even be at augusta before the masters let alone play all sports golf there,0
it’s always a blessing whenever they decide to play everybody’s favorite battle another round of all sports golf,1
this is the greatest video ever made  well done dude perfect bryson the full team,1
as much as i love seeing these battles i think the guys should change the frisbees to the disc golfing frisbees they travel farther than the regular ones,1
awesome video thanks to the masters management for allowing this great way to keep those youngsters involved very generous from the masters as always all class,1
i attended the masters on thursday and the woods on 15 was a great place to stand for a while so many golfers ended up there and got to see them up close what a fantastic experience,1
this arsenal side is proving itself very nicely playing with a lot more fluidity what a signing gabriel has been for them,1
arsenals attack is so fluid and theyre playing so well man theyre fr looking real dangerous this season,1
all game the fans were loud and behind the team especially the saliba chant this team is different and they’re together coyg,1
it’s such a shame that the gabriel jesus goal was ruled offside he’s playing out of his skin at the moment and deserved that goal zinchenko played amazing today marteneli and jesus are always a threat and xhaka has been playing well consistently under his new role and ofc we gotta talk about saliba so young yet he plays like a veteran special mention to ben white who’s also been playing good at right back,1
3 wins won’t guarantee us a top 4 finish but it’s better than 3 defeats which is where we were last season,1
its great to see arsenal win the games they are supposed to win excited to see them against top 4 competition,1
114 no sport event anywhere in history can come near this one god himself,0
the last one wasnt great its a foul in footballing terms and always results in a yellow card other players have done the same and been booked for it too as did henry in that last clip,0
if this guy calls zlatan “zlatan” one more time,0
canelo and plants speech gave me the chills man he was truly sad he lost the fight,0
dave winfield of the new york yankees accidentally hit and killed a seagull with a baseball in toronto vs the blue jays august 1983 he was charged with cruelty to animals and an autopsy was even done on the seagull it created a lot of controversy here in toronto,0
the jags v texans one always kills me the db did exactly what you’re taught to do don’t go for the int just knock it down much more effective than trying to go up with an nfllevel receiver just so unlucky lmao,0
kevin de bruyne is insane newcastle need to be taken seriously this season,0
248 i wouldve dropped everyone around me,0
correction in south africa kaiser chiefs fans take it too far,0
the reason for the beach balls in israel a team that doesn’t play well is “going to the beach” so their fans threw beach balls because they sucks,0
i’ll never understand opposing teams not helping a player outunawareness aside such a stupid thing help each other out,0
915 this father actually died from the fall trying to get his son a ball so sad,0
man at 710 got crossed so bad he did a split hilarious,0
crashing on hard plywood floors in basketball worstpossiblepain,0
the right side of the midfield is gonna be an absolute quagmire went right over my head,0
3 games in to the season might seem like a bit too soon to be worried about this liverpool team but the early indications are that the liverpool midfield is literally paper thin when it comes to resources as a long time lfc supporter i cant help but compare the decision to let sadio mane go to the same situation with xavi alonso some years back i think that j klopp is going to have to put in some serious time working with this squad to get anywhere close to a top 4 position this year hope i am wrong but if i am being honest man utd should have been 40 up at halftime,0
they missed manè and nobody wants to admitted sorry,0
three weeks in and the table is unrecognizable,0
if liverpool dont sign at least 2 players midfielders before the transfer window closes making top 4 will be very difficult and as for vvd looks like he is getting too complacent this season,0
perisic has brought so much offensive danger to the wings for spurs which is deadly considering someone of kanes quality waiting for those headers,0
i feel as though spurs is not overwhelmingly great compared to other top teams in bpl but what makes them so deadly is their continuous pressure and effort which shows around 2nd half,0
it’s crazy how much haaland can affect the game even with few touches his runs are always pulling players and opening up space for city to play once they start getting used to him being there for tap ins too it’s gonna be even scarier,0
foden cant do that bs that was a tap in for haaland,0
adam smith should have been given a red card,0
if i was haaland would have been pissed at foden too,0
honestly you can’t even be surprised that bauer acts the way he does he grew up bullied by kids and adults who always told him he was nothing and worthless that shit stays with you,0
will you make people stop cheating no alright then im just going to openly use the method of cheating and tell anyone and everyone,0
as someone who was bullied heavily as a kid i can see theres a few outcomes of that sort of situation and one of them is people become complete antisocial assholes like bauer,0
he literally said i’m going to cheat too if nobody wants to stop everyone else he was the one who made it so public and now we have umpires checking all the time,0
bro you did my boy wrong by calling him talentless hippy ,0
the boat saving the balls is litteraly the goat,0
bro the random dog on the soccer field stopping the goal like he’s airbud has me in tears ,0
bro the random dog on the soccer field stopping the goal like he’s airbud has me in tears ,0
a lot of talk about highlights but no highlights typical cbs… talk,0
patricias pencil don’t write on plastic,0
liverpool is such a disappointment even scrubs like man u can get the better of them smh,0
hate these stupid zoom conferences,0
prop 12 not knowing how to throw ,0
218 someone needs to take that glove away before he pokes an eye out,0
thank you for the lack of basketball highlights,0
doesn’t matter who we buy at this point once they’re here they’ll regress beyond recognition,0
i think casemiro is a quality player and a quality singing i don’t believe he’ll be ‘unmotivated’ because he’s won everything he’s a world class cdm which we need but it’s madness that we’ll be paying that money for him at this point in the window crazy it reeks of absolute desperation,0
quality player is casemiro also a dm which weve cried out for the concern with this signing though is how much more motivation will he have to still achieve having won everything multiple times over at madrid we are said to pay him an eyepopping 400k a week is what ive heard thats typical united one of our biggest problems has been paying insane wages resulting in comfortable unmotivated players who we then cant move on when its time as i say quality player but just seems like one that may help to stabilise us a bit more again but wont helps us achieve anything substantial as for pulisic ive always been quite underwhelmed by him albeit you can see he does possess good quality i probably wouldnt be averse to a loan though it cant be any worse than banging our heads against a brickwall hoping rashford does anything productive every week,0
we are a absolute mess if casemiro was the target why wasnt he signed 2 months ago we just panic and buy whoever with no strategy man im not saying casemiro is a rubbish player he is quality its just man utds approach to signings is a joke plus im not overly keen on giving a 30 year old a 5 year contract at 250k a week but ill literally take anything over scott and fred,0
united have 2 big transfer problems right now 1 literally everyone in football knows how bad the situation is at united and it means alot of good players are simply going to refuse to go here regardless how much money we offer them haaland is a good example 2 the players we can get the clubs they play for know how desperate we are and are naturally gonna jack up the price to get as money money as possible,0
west ham look terrible thus far graham potter is doing incredible things at brighton,0
brighton is the team people are actually sleeping ontheyre in a good standing at the moment but nobody is paying attention,0
ive been down my whole life and now look at me now look at me now god those words tears are speaking,0
so many people said edwards didnt even deserve the shot most underrated most disrespected fighter in the sport casuals with opinions baffling look at him now leon edwards is the quintessential gray man dark horse he does not train at altitude and epo dope so the altitude really affected his output throughout the fight the headkick was well read and calculated incredible,0
arsenal haters you didnt beat anyone and it is only 3 games into the season also arsenal haters last season you were beat by a championship team and have lost all your three games you are staring at relegation ,0
wonderful group of cars i would have a tough time choosing between the lotus gt4rs i thought the color combo on that ferrari was in poor taste it does not look good to my eyes,0
i feel like the 765 doesn’t belong in this list at all almost unfair,0
muler is more ballboi than a footballer,0
well that’s a costume i didn’t know could be sexual ,0
ivan toneys mitro celebration probably a lil awkward now,0
man dont you hate it when you get stuck on a deserted island end up clapping a fish woman only for the fish woman to suddenly choose to clap the only other guy on the island i know i do,0
i get knowing is half the battle but the other half is extreme violence ,0
i mean to be fair stomping on their hand when they try to make their presence known peacefully only to get shanked in the eye through a peephole a while later does indeed anger anyone not just smart fish people,0
actually if its currently september 1914 and he left 67 days ago that would have been a week or two after arch duke franz ferdinand was assassinated and an englishman like friend wouldnt have known a fullblown world war was about to clack off since austriahungary wouldnt declare war until a few weeks until after he set sail,0
this guys body language tells me that he is uncomfortable with this interview and that he is withholding information,0
god his children must’ve had such a hard time lying to him,0
the guy is giving a simplified summary for total beginners and people think it is an exact account if the methods they use agents have spoken with innocent and guilty people their knew how to account for simple nerves and a guilty person they know how to establish a baseline to account for individual traits and most importantly none of this can be used too convict you they cant just say yep hes the murderer he is lying and throw you in prison it is just a tool to help then when interrogating so they can have an idea if when they are being lied too or who they should focus on they still need to investigate and find actual proofv to convict you if you didnt do it they cant convict you just because you seemed like you were lying,0
my dad was a drill sargent in the army he had the ability to read peoples behavior like thisit was unnerving to have him explain my behavior to me,0
i’m honestly starting to get the impression that being a french woman means putting 100 of your energy into being the sexiest woman in the room but then pretending you don’t try at all,0
i bet a lot of french people are rolling their eyes at this,0
being succinct is great now how long will it take for you to learn that people dont appreciate being mislead or flat out lied to do another ted talk when you figure that part out side note youve known this information for a long time this is why the most important information is buried at the bottom the media uses it to their advantage which is why in most cases the first half tends to be pointless and boring or aimed at narrative people stop paying attention so never get to the actual information,0
i know at least 5 ways to deal with them 1 never take their words personally always have this suspicion in mind that they do not wish good for you so you shouldnt trust their opinion of you 2 dont compete with them it is futile and drains your energy 3 if they attack you stay calm indifferent and if possible give them a sneaky compliment the odds are they are used to people attacking them back and it takes them off guard when you see the positive things in them rather than the negative 4 dont become them if they are negative be positive if they lie tell the truth if they speak behind your back speak to their face always lead with example because they might not simply have the skills to do that 5 do not trust them dont tell them personal details about your life or things they could use against you keep your distance and value your boundaries protect yourself,0
this only works if all people involved are reasonable if one or more parties cant be reasoned with then the problem continues you can communicate until youre blue in the face but if the other person isnt willing to communicate appropriately then youve hit a brick wall,0
their bad behavior shouldnt be the cause of your heartattack brilliant,0
cannot communicate with sociopaths on any reasonable level people who cannot empathize will never see things from your point of view someone who is a sociopathic master manipulator can only be dealt with by affecting what matters most to them money unfortunately office sociopaths who gaslight daily rarely get reprimanded they have everyone else in the office convinced they are wonderful and that you are the problem best solution is to remove yourself from that environment,0
my mother used my “successes” as her gauge to show approval and basic humanity it was never enough for her to show love only maybe enough to prevent the threats of leaving or avoid hearing that i was a complete failure take it from me don’t push your children towards your goals it only teaches them that they aren’t good enough to make it on their own i was “successful” in school and was the first in my family to get a degree but i was also the most miserable sad child of all 10 of us kids is that success i know it isn’t,0
we are imperfect people trying to raise perfect children go figure,0
l honestly think that we adults are victims of bad parenting whats worse is that we are repeating history on our offspring,0
pro tip dont enter a death game called die now,0
person does literally anything cinema summary “that was their biggest mistake”,0
i love how his videos are so calm and nice for the first minute and then he realizes he didnt do it right and it turns into destruction,0
the amount of effort this guy puts in his videos is insane,0
all the dislikes were magicians that are mad that u revealed there big secret lol,0
my thing has been the shifting of schedules to match my chronotype just the violence of waking up at 6h30 was unbearable for me and when i went to college and picked classes that started at 10 at the earliest it was a game changer i am not sleeping more hours maybe less hours even because college but i am never truly tired anymore,0
i have ptsd and clinical depression so i always feel tired ive been subjected to things i wouldnt wish on anyone and even that was way easier than trying to get out of bed is for me now please take care of yourselves treatment for depression is very effective dont worry about potential side effects because one very common side effect of depression is that you pass away,0
do a video on how to survive planet earth its a fact that 100 of humans have died there so it would be nice to know how to survive it,0
403 2324 2852 well no one would watch a show called “orange pear” what does that even mean 5058 s t e p 3 n o b o d y d a t e s m y s i s t e r,0
hi jatz i am having a problem with the competition can u help how to avoid automatic price drop to buy box,0
this is very valuable advice it’s easy to overthink and completely lose track of your end goal this can be detrimental to your future thanks ali,0
the best way to stop overthinking is understanding that no amount of overthinking will lead to positive results in fact all it will do is cause more stress and anxiety for yourself more likely leading to the problem only getting worse,0
the movie explains how to kill him you need to make him be afraid you what ever he turns into you need to face that fear and fight back once pennywise realises that you arent scared he will begin to starve because he feeds off of fear once he starves and is weakened you can finish him off for good,0
laughter defeats fear it would have made more sense in the remake if instead of bullying and insulting it they start laughing at how silly and not frightening the clown really is without any fear it gets weaker and weaker until it finally shrinks down to the bug it truly is,0
the reason why pennywise said fear when he was defeated is not because he will spread more of it its because he is feeling fear and he let go for 2 reasons so he can go down to his lair and because hes in shock,0
can someone tell me why they never list the quantities of the ingredients or how long to let things sit for,0
254 that party would be over already before you could even melt the candy ,0

they removed the trust verification by removing the dislike number from being seen yes i get all the arguments of why they did it but people can watch a video to see if the dislike ratio is justified and read the comments to why the dislike was made its sort of like reading reviews on a product you are purchasing,0
i remember when vaping was purely prescribed to recovering smokers 10 years ago my friends mother had a vape that looked exactly like a cigarette and was recommended to her by a proffesional now i see middle schoolers sharing them in the parking lot of the school,0
making a separate comment for this one thing you didnt mention in the exploding vape part of the video is counterfeit batteries you mentioned faulty batteries poorly designed vapes but i think this is a big one that should not be left out most people who vape seek out batteries from known reputable brands however theres a huge problem of cheap counterfeit imitations of those batteries being sold under the original brand name even on places like amazon amazon have a huge problem with counterfeit products being sold through their website and it has really tarnished their brand in many peoples eyes,0
a shame how quickly vapes went from a better alternative to cigarettes to public heath hazard and under scrutiny,0

i think one of the greatest losses to history is that most people think egypt and china are very far from each other yes they are quite distant and it would take an individual months to do it but it wasnt an individual it was a series of peoples just because they didnt have planes or the combustion engine doesnt mean people werent crossing continents not a person or persons but people your friendly neighborhood druid,0

no one is above the law his wife says words have no conviction when its for your drunken husband,0
yes personal responsibility…quit blaming the person who “served him”…he’s an adult he chose to drink drive,0

high fashion is sometimes very abstract very elitist very bizarre and sometimes purely ridiculous but if you push all of the crazy price tags aside and all the ridiculous celebrity endorsers too you find artisans people who study and excel in a craft they deserve to be highlighted more behind that overpriced chanel bag is a leatherchainfabric artisan and years of creative thought and passion fast fashion is slowly killing our planet water consumption landfills toxic chemical dumped in village waters people paid pennies etc haute couture is rare it’s scarce i find the luxury scene beyond ridiculous but i love my high end pieces that have lasted me years and will continue to do so behind these fashion shows are artisans that will always be better than any fast producing machine,0
the worst thing to happen to fashion was ‘influencers’ who encourage always wanting the next instead of appreciating the now and the classic they’re so fickle and encourage everyone else to be the same,0
i love how “luxury” is about preserving the craft and labor of the poor for the rich like what really is the point here is it the small artisans who get and praise or the fashion “houses” and companies that actually get to design exploit labor and sell for profit  the definition just isn’t strong enough for me to care,0
i used to love high fashion but the more i learn about what goes on in the industry the more i feel like pursuing a different career choice so much nepotism elitism and lack of creativity it’s almost as if you don’t fit within certain enclaves you’re not welcomed,0
what annoys me the most is that these so called a majority of these high class fashion brands exploit their workers with long hours and little pay even though they are selling products for an extremely high price tag,0

my concern is that with the big players waking up to this business model they will muscle in easily and squeeze out these little guys who was doing well below the radar now that the cat is out of the bag their profitability will experience more headwinds going forward,0
i remember watching a documentary about how the area of west africa had become a dumping ground for usedunwanted clothes from europe and the americas more specifically the north americas i was totally shocked and had no idea about this villagers would sometimes travel for several miles on foot sometimes with their kids to pick through this clothing waste to sell into their communities and earn money most of it just became literal mountains of clothes on the beaches and wherever,0

when can cbnc actually show someone who created something cool like a product turned business an interesting yt channel maybe they publish their own books etc rather than these woefully unqualified finance “gurus” who add more detriment than value to most of its customers,0

i can relate what sis tshepi was saying about her business n her hubbys business it happened to my mothers business n she cried for a week if not a mnth,0
i feel so fake wanting to make a business because i feel whatever i make has already been made and idk if it’s gonna be better than those already made so it scares me,0
i feel like small business owners like put their heart and soul into their packages and try to get it shipped in time but they still dont get appreciated for their hard work,0
the package look more expensive than the actual product,0

hi nana you might want to know that the demo project mongodb no longer works with the latest image i had to use mongo316 which was the latest version at the time you recorded this video it might be worth adding a note to your video at 11945 that those following along should use mongo316,0
one thing with the dark souls tutorial is that the boulder will almost always hurt a new player so when they get the estus and told to use it they can see their health increase as a result,0

if u ever feel useless in life just remember there are idiotic fools that dislike a 6 hour video of a man teaching how to use python for absolutley free,0
after 25 years i am returning here to say that i’ve just accepted a job offer for a good salary and my it journey started here from this video in november of 2019 this was my first source of information when i got back from work being a cable tech and typed “python full course” or something along those lines of course back then a lot of concepts like classes and inheritance meant nothing to me and this video perhaps wasn’t the most beginner friendly however i was so sick of my job and i absolutely saw no growth in doing cable where the salary cap for a technician was probably it jobs base pay for the most part so i decided to google every single thing i don’t understand and i successfully changed careers,0
the minecraft way step 1 build a temporary box house or cave home step 2 after playing for awhile and gathering materials prepare to build your new house step 3 look up some builds people have done for their houses for inspiration step 4 realize that to accomplish any of those youll need to get 10x the resources you already have and spend like 10 hours of dedicated building time step 5 stop playing for 8 months step 6 start playing again but feel completely lost and confused as to wtf you were doing step 7 decide to start a new world so you can just start from the start instead of trying to remember everything from your current world step 8 return to step 1,0
i love that the narrator is particularly enraged at the horrific cheesecake tutorial usually the narrator performs with an impersonal almost inhumane robotesque anonymity and objectiveness but here you start to see their own real personality come through just a bit whoever they are they must be an avid baker to be so enraged by the british womans baking faux pas hahaha,0

im surprised td ameritrade was 1 fidelity gives the best execution in my experience for nonoption trades and free trades interactive brokers provides fast order execution but you have to pay fees if you are a trader robinhood is by far the worst excessive pof others use pof but not to the extreme of robinhood,0
robinhood is severely underrated,0
interest rates go up people spend less businesses and peoples loan costs go up the sad thing about inflation is that even when you get it under control the damage is done and those prices never go back down i’m putting all of my profits into silver gold bitcoin ethereum and food,0
that’s why you do a limit order and never a market order quite a misleading story the assumption is that retail traders don’t know how to place a trade with a limit order,0
the last two years was also the worst time to buy real estate its met it bubble peak though and will take some time to resettle,0
homes are being way overvalued time for sellers to come down to reality,0
this painful plateau of economic misery will continue for years there are too many forces propping up the market itll never get back down to the average person anymore because the institutional money will grab much of the property before it does there are also so many more options for homeowners than simply selling now sideways for years to come and the next generations go downhill hopefully it was worth the greed of the asset bubble the fed created,0
not a great time for buyers right up until prices crash and blackrock comes in and sweeps em all up on the cheap in cash homeowners that cant pay an absurd mortgage can rent for exorbitant rates after they boost the prices back up you will own nothing and you will not be happy,0
real estate will just be one of the dead markets tied to the collapse of everything though,0
sorry for people who paid 50 or 60k more than the asking price in the last 2 years,0

the two major nuclear disasters happened because of 1 incompetence chernobyl and 2 natural disaster fukushima as a british citizen i would say that on the most part we are very capable of preventing those two things we’ve wasted 30 years of nuclear understanding and fine tuning in my opinion let’s get those plants running baby,0
i think anyone who has spent time working in a modern agile corporate environment could tell you the crux of the problem in an instant we no longer plan past the next quarter supply chain bottleneck is just another way of saying that we let the beancounters run the show and they were good at it right until something happened which they could neither model nor predict cerveza the system is brittle by design because its so much cheaper that way nuclear energy runs counter to this business ethos its a huge engineering lift it takes 20 years to pay itself off you need a trained workforce with domestic production and fabrication capacity that can forge the parts machine them weld them then certify and maintain them over a period of 40 years instead weve been gleefully shutting profitable factories at home gutting workforces funneling everyone into college resulting in massive brain drain skill loss as the old timers machinists retire but hey we delivered a lot of value for shareholders and now the chickens are coming home to roost,0
excellent video marko things look really bad for now just recently it was reported that germans among many others probably already spend their savings to fight inflation instead of having their salaries rise to cover it i dont want to imagine what will happen in the winter when the energy bills will really increase or when those savings run out,0
hi marko im living in the germany not born though and have been following your podcast because you do good analysis honestly as a european i feel quite disappointed by everything i understand why the administration decided not to invest in nuclear energy after fukushima accident but on the other hand i cannot understand how they didnt invest in other resources or should i say how the europe especially germany didnt diversify when it comes to energy suppliers its like you said they just ignored that fact even though we already had a couple of years ago possible no delivery situation with russia,0

inflations getting crazy i’m gonna have to start cutting down on things like making payments soon,0
things are going to get a lot worse… i can’t see a way out of this… your liberal government is more concerned with ukraine… they haven’t done anything to help you…a canadian… keep voting the same way and get the same results…,0
im concerned about the federal government sending workers to sneak into saskatchewan and trespass on private property then theres the sending mps to taiwan to stir the war pot also did anyone else notice the very enthusiastic greeting deputy tweak gave the german chancellor she know hes probably only here to have a hot shower,0
as inflation soars and the economy slows be sure to thank your local liberal member of parliament or your local ndp member of parliament because inflation is the direct result of liberal federal government monetary policy with such policies shamelessly supported by the ndp,0
and this is the problem with voting and hiring on the basis of diversity,0

yea it sucked to watch my portfolio tank in real time but i also knew that while stocks lose 36 on average in bear markets they gain 114 in bull markets so i ignored the news kept buying more index funds and waited millionaire in 2025 talking about investing in 2022,0
most times it amazes me greatly the way i moved from an average lifestyle to earning over 63k per month utter shock is the word i have understood a lot in the past few years to doubt that opportunities abound in the financial markets the only thing is to know where to focus,0
i am new to the stock market every stock that i bought so far i was out of luck because i bought them when they were expensive i feel i missed out on all the stock opportunities so far for the tech stocksi believe having 75k yearly income would be a good investment so i want to plug all my savings into the stock market i know this sounds a bit dull but i would like to know if i should learn investing or let somebody else more capable like a fa do it for me please share your thoughts i am kind of tired of searching for a good stock to buy and losing all the good opportunities,0
yahoo going into overdrive trash talking ryan i can smell that they are scared,0
with the way things are moving i think i need to see a video on how to survive amidst the present recession i mean everything is in shambles surprisingly i heard people still make over 100k within a few months and id like to know how and if it is still possible in these times or if i am being lazy,0
the sad thing about inflation is that even when you get it under control the damage is done and those prices never go back down the market won’t crash until after the midterms i’m putting all of my profits into silver gold bitcoin ethereum and food,0
but i thought that we didnt have enough houses i thought demand was so high the money money money would keep coming ,0
my opinion depending on location and what happens with all the foreclosure notices that are starting to pop up it is either heading into a correction or possibly a crash def not easy to predict,0
that was a mic drop moment right there heck yea transitory sounds like forward guidance to me income inequality is also a huge problem our government needs to do something about but lacks the will to do so now the entire economy will suffer because of not taking care of our less advantaged in society,0
we are already in the big crash inflation is a catastrophe this cpi report is a colossal failure to bring the housing market to a halt the fed will have to pull all the stops the unfortunate issue is that other markets are being decimatedif you want to stay green you have to rely on a lot of diversification currently up 14 and being careful still a better deal than leaving it in a savings or checking account yielding 01 percent interest,0

i can hear the we want ratcliffe chant as a united fan a selfmade working class roots billionaire who lived 8 miles from old trafford supporting united being a united owner you couldnt write the script its unbelievable,0
if mu fans really want the glazes out you have to hurt them where they care the most money boycott the club commercial sell and their sponsors lower their tv broadcast viewsstadium attendancesocial media activity ratings etc all these together will brought down the valuation of the club really weaken the glazess position and help potential buyers protest along is meaningless before that i doubt anything will happen,0
this puts things to bed imo however the fact that ratcliffe openly made this statement may prompt them into a potential sale after all sponsors and partners are starting to have cold feet and that would definitely push them out especially if as expected our season goes pear shaped,0
im 54 and my wife and i are very worried about our future gas and food prices rising daily we have had our savings dwindle with the cost of living into the stratosphere and we are finding it impossible to replace them we can get by but cant seem to get ahead my condolences to anyone retiring in this crisis 30 years nonstop just for a crooked system to take all you worked for,0
there is a perfect storm brewing in america inflation sever drought in the farm belt the pandemic food shortages diesel fuel and heating fuel shortages baby formula shortage shortage of and price of available cars the price of housing its all coming together and could lead to real disaster toward the end of this yearor sooner,0

in the aftermath of the recent asian financial crisis many blamed international institutions corruption governments and flawed macro and microeconomic policies not only for causing the crisis but also unnecessarily lengthening and deepening it at the turn of this century most economists in the developed world believed that major economic disasters were a thing of the past or at least relegated to volatile emerging markets financial systems in rich countries the thinking went were too sophisticated to simply collapse,0
dude thinks wage increases are the cause of inflation when it has been massively under inflation and people are being payed less value year after year since the 70s they mass printed haulted production and services filled their balance sheets and took on massive amounts of debt wage increases are a result of dilution not the cause,0
if inflation stay at current level soon or later the bond market will collapse then following will be the collapse of stock market there is no other option but to keep tightening money supply until inflation back to sustainable level this is the effect of 20 years of horrific monetary policy qe too much stimulus the fed added 25 trillions of debt to it balance sheet since 2000 and all the plans to reduce it deficit have failed and in the contrary they continue to increase the deficit each year they can blame the ukraine war or covid that caused inflation but the reality is just poor monetary policy made by the central government over decades the only question left is how much tightening they can do without causing a hard recession in an already vulnerable economy,0
economys fine no cause for concern just like in 1980 1990 2001 2007 2020 right the problem is the economy is a mess because the money supply and fiscal policy is too loose but the economy is now dependent on a loose money supply and loose fiscal policy just to function so no matter what you do 1 nothing 2tighten or 3 loosen the economy suffers,0

funny enough the argument that bitboys business is advice is incredibly dangerous for him coming from someone who is actually registered to give financial advice there is a lot of regulation around who can give financial advice and what you can say if thats your business needless to say bitboy has probably violated a few rules on that front normally youtubers are protected from liability because their business youtube technically isnt advicebased admitting your business is advicebased though might open you up to liability im not a lawyer but i know a bit about the legality of financial advice happy to touch base if it would help,0
this is terrible glad you’re going to fight back and i really hope that you get the result that you deserve if he hadn’t hurt his brand before this alone is going to damage it completely now and it’ll be his own fault entirely,0

this fits the definition of a slapp suit strategic lawsuits against public participation or strategic litigation against public participation are lawsuits intended to censor intimidate and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a legal defense until they abandon their criticism or opposition,0
hey erling paralegal here i saw the end of your video but would still recommend getting an attorney to help with handling this suit lawsuits are not fun in any way unless your the attorneyfirm and they cause an unimaginable amount of stress my parents were victim of a certain suit and it really followed them everywhere and lingered in the back of their minds always moreover if the other side has an attorney they have the advantage of knowing how the system works such as what needs to be exchanged during the discovery phase rule 26a dislcosures interrogatories evidence you intend to use at trial depositions of plaintiffs defendants and expert witnesses etc and when to make appearances for compliance meetings with the judge i truly admire your resolve to stand your ground and defend yourself just be careful with how you proceed pay attention to deadlines and what needs to be done also remember its a legal system and not a justice system this is not legal advice just a concerned fan lawyers or other legal professionals please correct anything i may have overlookedunintentionally misconstrued ps i think the service the guy who threw the papers at you rudely was fine unfortunately you identified yourself once that happens they can just leave it at your doorstep,0

why should we choose between gold standard or bitcoin standard i want to have it all at once gold bitcoin silver if we are squeezed in one standard the risk to be gamed is infinite high,0
bitcoin is only durable if there is electricity and network connections in times of crisis and in many places around the world these things are unreliable also if keys are lost the bitcoins associated with them are gone forever,0
yeah this is so insane the lawsuit is super laughable lmao,0
the defamation suit made his image worse lmao had no idea who he was till the lawsuit and now all i do is laugh at the man child,0
some people are just too sue happy hurt feelings from people stating opinions dont count bro he definitely stepped wrong on this because now someone like me who has zero interest in crypto because of excessive cynicism knows about him and knows to steer clear he did this not atozy or coffeezilla he put his reputation on the line instead of ignoring it and letting it roll off his back,0
he always sues everyone hes a well known scammer who gets paid to promote crypto scams hes got a reputation,0
can’t wait seeing him under oath asked how much money he’s taken to promote scams he’s digging his own grave on this one,0

thank you for your videos mateits normal to see so many investors panic amid a worsening bearish market but it is also important to note that the market situation is nothing new in the crypto world several factors are driving negative sentiment in the stock and crypto markets right now including inflation a shaky stock market rising interest rates and recession fears as a result bitcoin has dropped significantly from its alltime high breaking below several key technical levels as a crypto investor the current situation might seem bleak however there are several tried and tested expertsuggested investment strategies that can help you accumulate the current crypto storm in few weeks of implementing trading with accurate signals directly from mr ryan donald i have been able to accumulate over 11 btc despite the current state of the market,0

i live in the netherlands europe and got news for you we are already in an energy crisis gas price has gone 12x at the moment compared to prices pre covid that translates in 4x the price if you need a nrw energy contract so people here pay easy 600 a month instead of 150 euro but in 2023 prices are expected 800 to 1000 euros a month that means an insane recession you think the bearmarket is almost over think againit only just started,0
in my younger years i guided flyfishing in alaska when looking out the window of the float plane sometimes i’d see ponds that almost looked like they were boiling it was natural gas coming up through the permafrost the arctic regions of europe have these same stores of natural gas they need to utilized as a measure of self sufficiency energy independent and security the idea they haven’t thought of this is crazy to rely on countries that harbor governments that brutalize their own citizens is not good business did you turn your back on the bully at school smiling and being nice is one thing but being in bed with evil is another,0
great video europe should also expect an extreme winter much like the extreme summer they have just experienced so the stores will definitely not be enough,0
spare change investible assets will be vastly curtailed stores of value will be tapped to pay for increased prices,0

banks hate crypto because people prefer to have usdt in their wallet instead of usd in a bank account,0
the reason the eu is so low has to do with the fact that countries in the eu such as italy spain portugal and cyprus since they still have large debts with the european bank can therefore not raise interest rates the countries can not repay their debt properly so that the debt becomes higher unfortunately these countries are still not doing anything in their country to ensure that their internal economies run better,0

crypto makes being a thief a piece of cake no government oversight you pump up the numbers on your wallet the value goes up up people think they will make a profit so they invest their cash months later the price drops the cash has already been transferred to an offshore account so long suckers,0
hopefully bitboys next lawsuit isn’t a civil one it’s heavily bordering scamming and he’s been the sole face of promotion could easily book him for aiding and co conscripting if they build up enough evidence,0

weve already been through market hell lol at this point nothing can surprise me or get me emotional eth can drop to 400 and btc to 14000 or less and i wouldnt even care anymore honestly over it at this point dont have chips to buy the dip unfortunately but i sure as hell aint selling any till im sitting pretty,0
the polygon token has lost its utility since it will no longer be used for gas fees can you tell us why youre still buliish on it,0
eth will be a dump on everyone it’s already priced it once it climbs they will cash out then repeat,0

no sound audio issue,0
when you send the rubik’s impossible in a different angle that doesn’t look solved,0
in my opinion 3x3 blindfolded is the hardest because you need to remember all the move and the scramble and you cant see it when you are solving,0
the hardest i can do is the 1x1,0
first ive been questioning myself how does jperm know all those names second how is he this rich,0
3417 do you see it the big edge pieces which everything turns around are actually the centers the cloverleaves are actually the edges and for the corners half of them look like centers and the other half are actually hidden inside the puzzle this means you actually have to look on the inside of the puzzle to see if those pieces are there and that just makes it really hard,0
this is insane respect,0
like this comment if you think i have a career in opera please dont edit everyone complaining about the 14 16 and 18 see the video description,0
i own a 0x0 super hard to solve it keeps slipping through the atoms of my hand,0
440 cubers be like wtf how is 1 hand inpressive he can’t even do it in 30 seconds,0
on the thumbnail a 30x30 rubik’s cube would just completely fall apart if you turn it without increasing the size of the outer layers,0
427 being a speedcuber watching him say “how do you even do that one handed” hurts me inside edit everything about this video hurts me inside,0
1 wrong move and its all gone,0
ahhh the life of a scammer,0
i personally would switch the places of the metal and the smallest i lose things easily especially that tiny cube,0
you cant use the timer on a black surface as black doesnt reflect infrared light try using it on a white table,0
sees white me you liar,0
him calls a gan cube a regular cube me wait thats illegal,0
i really appreciate you covering the colorblind aspect i have to have grey instead of green and black instead of orange on my cubes because of my color deficiency and it means significantly less choice in cubes its very frustraiting,0
for me whether or not the cube is stickered actually matters a lot i have always used a stickerless cube and when i got a stickered cube i noticed that i was a lot worse at look ahead i made more mistakes in f2l and took longer to look,0
i have always used stickerless cubes from when i learned all through now one day a friend and i swapped cubes to see how our times got affected by using each other cubes i like my cubes fast he likes them slower his main was a stickered cube not only was i turning bad because the cube was slower then i was use to but the stickers felt so weird i just cant use stickered cubes because of the edge on the sticker,0
i prefer stickered on 3x3 because i love the look any bigger cubes the amount of stickers just makes it not worth it to me to many that can get damaged and replacing stickers gets exponentially more annoying i would probably feel differently if the stickers from speedcubeshop werent as good as they are so i would still take a stickered 3x3 over a stickerless given the option,0
dayum what a game breaking dupe i hope the developers patch this soon,0
teacher nothing is infinite the cube you dare defy me mortal,0

i have the spherical one my friend aradhay pronounced aradyu has a pyraminx the rediminx seems easy but its actually hard the moyu puppet cubes are so weird,0
it was hard enough for me to solve the normal axis cube i can’t imagine doing the 4x4,0
i was solving it whole night with your trick and finally it didnt solve,0
tingman really just destroyed the internals of 170 of cubes for this one video thats dedication,0
i tried it with an already jumbled cube no it didnt workeven it got messed up even more lol and i did absolutely as instructed ,0
i really dont know how people can solve it and read the cube so fast with just colors,0
alternate title never let a non cuber touch your expensive cubes ever again,0
i like how this man can solve this damn cube in 13 seconds when it’s been 13 years since my last cube i still can’t even solve it,0
yeah yeah the time and the cubes are very different but the one thing everyone neglects is the price,0
the dedication that he had to not use one of those poles as a lightsaber and start breaking stuff is insane,0
the fact that people can even do 3x3 cubes is beyond me but watching this guy did a 15x15 and in only 2 and a half hours blew my mind on another level,0
this guy is insane i can’t even solve a 3x3 in 5 hours,0
i was at a trampoline park and after i was done jumping i decided to play some arcade games i won 500 tickets from one game and got my first rubiks cube from there it was really bad at maneuvering and would cause so much friction so i decided to try and move it really fast back and forth and it literally blew into pieces in the middle of the parking lot and scattered everywhere midday with spectators around safe to say i could never get it back together i ended up buying several speed cubes and i’m able to solve all of them,0
he puts the cube in the strange shape me being annoyed that he put orange to red,0
“this is 3 cubes” proceeds to make 4d shape in the multiverse from one single fucking 3d cube,0
i just realized that is impossible because the pieces have different colors on them except for the middle piece,0
me proceeds to turn one side of a completely red cube brain turn it back me what’s the worse that will happen cube turns into a scrambled 40x40 brain told you so,0
me trying in window just like him 1 st time my balance goes cube rip ,0
the guy got 2500x on €8 and didnt even bat an eye lid when it happened and yet people think this is real cmon,0
omg that was so  close to max,0
when you play it looks so easy when i play it looks like shit,0
even though you should be enjoying the game didn’t let you by leaving 2 cubes behind ,0
normal people today ill be showing you how to use a cube stand timmy this is how you can not use a cube stand,0
a wise man once said now thats a lot of damage,0
i recently got myself the impossible cube that you showed at the end there regular rubiks brand and it both popped and had stickers fall off right out of the box i believe they either dont give a shit because theyre still the largest or theyre incompetent,0
i have a rubiks cube thats almost 20 years old i got into cubing recently and bought a meilong as soon as i got some disposable pennies i always assumed that it turns this horrible at least in part because of its age but seeing how your brand new cube turns exactly like mine now i wish i could get my hands on a new one just to see if there is any difference,0
the og rubiks cube was set up to be basically temperamental child proof like you demonstrated you can throw it at a wall and the wall will lose that battle but its also super unlikely to pop or cornertwist during normal use noncubers often consider a cube broken if its popped or cornertwisted i remember having to rescue an expensive speedcube from the trash can because my cousin cornertwisted it that comes at the expense of having almost no cornercutting ability and having a lot of friction making it hard to turn but then again its not meant to be their speedcube the rubiks brand speedcube is still kinda terrible though but for different reasons,0
me can i get some ice with that jeanelle sorry our ice machine broke,0
“too lazy to make ice cubes” bro you pour water in a tray and leave it in a freezer that’s apl,0
me after trying metal icewhy does my water test like metal,0
just a tiny minus you cant chew on the ice,0
the one fear i have with these things is accidentally swallowing them its easy to forget theyre not really ice cubes id use a straw with these 100 of the time,0
i remember going to a friends house and seeing these but the plastic version and i thought they were real so i was there trying to bite through their plastic ice cubes while my friend just stared in shock,0
how to solve the rubiks cube faster ► please read this before commenting i try to reply often but i dont get step x or it doesnt work is too unspecific and i cant help unless i know exactly what problem you have make sure you know the 4 moves 152 has the 4 moves and you have to be able to do this to understand what 4 moves means when i use it again later on common first layer problems step 1 2 if the side colors of the cross or first layer dont line up the way i showed it in the video then you need to redo it pay attention to all of the colors on one piece and dont just pick white pieces randomly i talk about this in the video how im trying to match the other colors of the white piece like whiteorange etc taking pieces out of the second layer step 3 at 533 i say you should already know how to do this i admit this is unclear you should insert a random yellow edge into the second layer using the same algorithm you use for solving the second layer if this does not make sense watch the example solve video linked at the bottom of this comment common top layer problems step 4 if you can only get 1 or 3 edge pieces of the top cross you need to reassemble the cube as solved step 5 there should be no problems here step 6 if you ever get only 2 corners in the correct location you need to reassemble the cube as solved step 7 finish the 4 moves dont stop at 3 every time turn the bottom dont rotate the whole cube to get the next piece if it still does not work you need to reassemble the cube as solved why do i need to reassemble the cube randomly assembling the cube only has a 112 chance of being solvable if youve ever taken the cube apart or twisted corner pieces then that can be the problem if stickers have been switched you will have to switch them back full example solve,0
nothing hurts more than being on the last step and then messing up the algorithm,0
question is why would someone want to hide their rubiks cube that desperately,0
this stuff never fails to confuse the heck out of me,0
