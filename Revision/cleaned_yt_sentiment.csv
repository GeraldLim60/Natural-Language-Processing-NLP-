2,whenever i go to a place that oesn t take apple pay oesn t happen too often it s such a rag between contactless covi habits an my getting the apple car i ve gotten so use to apple pay that i get seriously annoye when a store oesn t take it it feels like a shock it s crazy how quickly it took over my shopping routine i ve officially been brainwashe by apple because now it feels so inconvenient to even carry a physical car in my pocket
3,apple pay is so convenient secure an easy to use i use it while at the korean an japanese airports no nee for physical cre it car s
4,we only got apple pay in south africa in 20202021 an it s wi ely accepte
5,in the unite states we have an abun ance of retailers that accept apple pay but its still goo to carry the physical car with you being there are still a large quantity of places that o not accept apple pay
6,wow you really went to town on the psu test rack thats a serious bit of kit very flexible goo choices woul nt surprise me if choma start offering this bespoke rack to the psu makers they all watch your vi eos so theyll want to make sure it passes on this exact same rack you can really push the in ustry here well one open source the test interface har ware an software
7,the lab is the most exciting thing in it ive seen for a while this is reallly going to shake up how the qualiity of even basic components are manufacture
8,linus im an engineer an love the lmg content across all the channels very much looking forwar to more lab content an hope your engineering team will get more on camera time an hosting roles
9,there use to be a time where linus was the smartest guy in the room this vi eo clearly shows that the team he has built are experts in their respective fiel s an make linus look like a chil ku os to linus an lmg youve grown beyon what i imagine all the best
10,holy crap i was looking at chroma systems back when i was esigning power supplies looks like you guys went all out re the multimeter most oscilloscopes are terrible for making accurate voltage measurements 810 bit a cs they are just for looking at the waveforms
11,i love the irection this channel is going most tech channels even the best truste ones are going to review pro ucts base on their own experience or at most some things they can measure with their pc but youre really going to mathematically emonstrate if a pro uct is a quality one an why it is love it
12,i am more excite for the ltt lab than i have been for a lot of content for a while now as everyone seems to be saying its exciting to see how enthusiastic this new crew is to get things running
13,i a ore the working relationship linus has with his team 99 of employees walk on eggshells aroun their boss an i wish it coul be more like this
14,lmgs growth is honestly something to truly aspire for this is the content we want to watch more technical in epth engineering oriente an sciencebase content will make us consumers much much more e ucate on these topics thus when picking a pro uct not only will we pick the best choice but well know exactly why we picke it which helps greatly with buyers remorse
15,i love all the people ltt has a e for labs clearly theyre knowle geable an passionate about tech labs is gonna be killer love it
16,linus just turn the key lights 180 an bounce them off the walls you ll get a much softer glow an sha ow an way more even lighting it s such a simple fix i m not sure where along the lines people got the i ea to beam the lights irectly at your face
17,an continues to be my new favorite he has such an air of confi ence about him an a comforting presence like an shows up an you just know things are going to be fine
18,an managing to set up his sol ering station on the one box they nee e was incre ibly amusing to me
19,linus gets on his employees cases for all the stuff stolen from the office also linus prou ly talks about all the stuff stolen from work hes using in his upgra e setup linus why are you using this monitor as a table also linus uses the monitor as a chair this vi eo was hilarious
20,an the man saving the ay riley nee s to give him his own theme like brian the electrician
21,an continues to be a favourite for me hes like the incre ibly patient but longsuffering a who just gets on with things
22,an is a treasure your channel has long lacke a mr fixit type an while i am sa its not me an appears quite capable an funny
23,blows my min how quickly an became the rock upon which all things linus stan slove it
24,hey linus a goo trick for streaming lights bounce them off the wall much easier on the eyes an a nice softer look also for in oors i recommen a hypercar ioi mic looks like a short shotgun like the au iotechnica at4053b

44,whenever we get people young enough to actually un erstan the internet these giant tech companies might be broken up but as long as we have 90 year ol senators asking tech ceos how the internet works nothing will get one
45,i live for johns roasts of att
46,ma respect to john oliver an his team for not making us watch a s uring the show major props
47,one important aspect im surprise was left out is that many of these companies like amazon literally power the internet almost 30 of the websites on the internet are store on amazon servers giving them even more access to ata tren s an physical control over the internet
48,back in 2018 when john oliver i the episo e on corporate consoli ation it inspire me so much that i applie for a masters of research program got into a program an i my entire research thesis on tech oligopolies it was shocking to see how ba it really is oligopolies that bor ere in monopolies are rampant my research essentially focuse on the question of whether lack of enforcement of our antitrust laws cause this whole problem or whether lack of a equate laws were the core of the issue the answer was that it was truly both i thoroughly enjoye my pre octoral masters thesis an am consi ering a ph in the future its so lovely to see john talk about this specifically on the tech sector e it wow thanks everyone for the great comments i havent publishe it yet otherwise i woul share it with all you lovely people i am now looking for a policy or qualitative researchanalyst job so if anyone is hiring let me know
49,john oliver eserves an oscar for his can olphins love you monologue
50,hey something that might interest you a couple of ays ago my amazon account was close with no warning for after hours of waste time theyre telling me its for excessive returns which i think is an error but thats besi e the point when they close my amazon account all my amazon evices that i own for years primarily all my echo evices stoppe working i lost access to the amazon photos an prime vi eo which i pay for so apparently the evices you alrea y own are subject to be isable by amazon on your perceive shopping habits i assume the same applies to all other amazon evices an services like fire os tablets ring cameras an probably aws as well just wante to make other people aware of this because they efinitely ont tell you this when you buy your har ware an services
51,hey hey just a hea s up i i turn the le hoo ie on its just not very bright hen youre looking faceon at it you can still sort of see it on aroun the hoo area though if you ha fun on this vi eo heres my collection of extreme unboxing vi eos

55,infinity o ecahe rons are seriously cool i bought another smaller one an i really enjoy it its efinitely an eye catcher an a conversation starter
56,i personally enjoy the ol school phones i have such a har time hearing my iphone at max volume without the speaker on if i worke in an office i woul efinitely buy one people forget how ergonomic those ol phones are its not particularly comfortable hol ing a rectangle to your hea i also have physically sensitive ears so any type of hea phones ear phones whatever cause me a bunch of pain looks like a goo pro uct that can both be a gag an something for people out there like me who have a tough time using a regular mobile phone
57,the fact he i nt buy the nicholas cage spoon is outrageous
58,i have to say it after watching this vi eo it feels like the journey youre on this year has been effective it simply feels like youre enjoying life an its what i enjoy most about watching your vi eos you manage to pass that joy on just the musings of a ran om stranger
59,i havent laughe like this for years oh my gosh arun youve naile this one wen i
60,quality quality quality is everything about this channel arun makes my moo happier vi eo after vi eo lets be searious the best part about this channel is arun making his jokes an when he shows tech
61,as somebo y with a comp sci egree an a ecent amount of irl experience i will say e ge computing is problematic at its core because client si e workloa like this is a huge security breach this is why even online vi eo games avoi client si e scripting it is a huge vector for exploit it is always interesting to watch a vi eo like this because you are blown away when you listen regar ing these other technologies you may not know allot about but when they cover a technology you know about you realize you must question the quality of the info in the other cases where you cannot etermine the quality yourself
62,the fire suppression without water was incre ible it coul save many lives an property especially if it coul be auto activate like a heat etector imagine how much property an how many sleeping people coul be save especially if this ha a built in alarm an was rigge to keep hallways clear of fire what an inventionwow
63,i really appreciate a stu y into the potential a vantages of meta materials in manipulating light emf heat an even replacing silicon as semicon uctors nearly every in ustry can benefit from the improvements an cost re uctions meta materials can provi e really enjoy your vi eos thank you
64,i was totally shocke that fusion power generation wasnt inclu e possibly as big a leap as quantum computing in its impact on humanity
65,i love the one about the hy rogen fuel cellsconsi ering this technology has been aroun for about 20 yearsjust hasnt been use ue to a lack of pressure on the in ustry an the fact that the patent was burie by large corporate interests
66,i wish that when people talke about types of skin amage they acknowle ge what that looks like for people with arker skin we ont get re rashes after sunburn even my arkest bruises are often ifficult to spot because of hyperpigmentation the stages of healing for cuts looks vastly ifferent because we ont see the same change in colors aroun the woun sight not to mention when you look for images to i entify clinical signs 99 of those images are of lighter skin an only marginally helpful to us looking to i entify potentially serious me ical issues
67,she has a very effective way of elivering information in a way that is accessible love her
68,if the lea singer is bret michaels then im sure it is poison that ha me laughing for ages
69,anne is so cool she makes me want to reevaluate my life choices an return to college to become a toxicologist
70,poison support is one of the more interesting ones of this series im gla to see anne back in the seat an schooling us hoping for more
71,my son ha botox injections in his legs for years to relax his muscles enough so he coul wear splits he has cerebral palsy its crazy knowing that this life changing treatment is also the most angerous poison
72,my mom woul ve gone nuts for you while i was growing up lol her big parent fear was toxic chemicals an me getting poisone so she was always lecturing me about stuff un er the sink an making sure i i nt touch the pestici es for the farm once she figure out she coul call pbs an they sen her mr yuck stickers the house an barn were covere in them

74,my husban got sun poisoning last year all the symptoms you escribe it was not fun he sai his sick were he got burne felt tight for a few months after luckily he is a nurse an he was able to give me a vice on how to help him in his recovery
75,marques oes a fantastic job highlighting the features of the link if youre looking for the next level of webcam look no further ope tech ope vi eo
76,the camera is amazing an there are so many people who coul benefit from it a lot
77,i ve been playing with the insta360 link for about a week now as a college professor an e tech trainer i can tell you that this is a complete game changer for online an hybri teaching switching from follow mo e to whiteboar mo e to top own mo e for emos etc is a purely magical experience
78,i honestly have to say while its still insanely expensive 3500 for that monitor isnt as ba as i was expecting an its almost reasonable like its still more than i woul ever spen on a single isplay an im far more into having separate isplays but given what its capable of the specs the tech behin it etc its not that ba i can see a few people getting real use out of something like that
79,imagine losing the cursor on that screen an trying to fin it
80,this monitor is perfect for streaming three 27 monitors in one is amazing but man is it expensive
81,i can see this being goo for e iting an streaming rea ing the chat an playing the game on one screen this is genius
82,geez i nee a e icate stu io for all of this ope tech in my future
83,this has gotta be one of the best ope techs everything here is a hit that i m ef writing own for later
84,i m always looking forwar to these every month so thank you for making them honestly that little lamp an speaker caught my eye the flickering is really cool to me an the speaker is a nice extra
85,the soun test kille me that was hilarious an the wrist rest is brilliant i often get marks on my wrist from my mousepa
86,what a tough selection this month whether it be the soun bar the lamp speaker or even the pc panel isplay they all seem something that woul really improve my set up but for me it may have to be the soun bar one looks smart has nice rgb an a ecent size an price very goo month of tech this month
87,i absolutely love this series all of the items were neat but the only one i woul actually benefit from woul be the chair wheels i have a regular office chair that has to roll on carpet an it is kin of a pain
88,that sensor panel is efinitely convenient been wanting to make my own with a raspberry pi but just fin myself getting off track super cool to just be able to purchase an go
89,the rgb soun bar woul be perfect for my setup i ve been using the speakers in my monitor as my main soun system so it woul be a nice upgra e for me
90,i always love franks energy i also look forwar to the en of every month thinking about this series i love the tilte nation soun bar an i nee that for my set up
91,always great to see this series so many cool things this month my office setup coul use those chair wheels
92,this series has helpe me an my frien s fin some helpful tech that has helpe our setups the pc panel is gonna be a huge upgra e
93,we nee the un er 100 for august as well this is the best series out there
94,one really important point those ionizers can pro uce potentially angerous levels of ozone ue to the negative ions they create in the air i be cautious of all air ionizers unless they are a vertise specifically as bipolar ionizers the one that you recommen e oes pro uce ozone which can be very harmful
95,been a goo while since ive been a stu ent but i still watche the vi to fin out what cool ga gets are out there i nt think i be walking away from it with a pro uctivity tip that i ea of the simple timer is so goo instea of evices that can also o time great vi frank
96,the esktop lamp is efinitely my favorite it s also something i ve been looking for because i up ate to a keyboar that oesn t have shine through keycaps so it s efinitely a nee too

114,am i the only one that actually watches these with snacks an rinks been here since 1
115,gotta let your son pick some boxes now he s ol enough to point one out start him in the family business early
116,i love all the interactions an laughs with everyone in this vi eo personally i think j picke the best tech
117,okay j that 130 was efinitely worth it i might get me one a goo buy for a traveling tech hea

121,i love you guys i hope you know that you guys brighten my ay with these massive tech unboxing vi eos
122,the whole i ea of the interchangeable battery to keep going of the steel series is exactly the reason why xbox still uses aa batteries for their controllers i think is in an un ervalue ecision from xbox
123,in my experience burnout comes from realizing that improve performance oesnt pro uce improve rewar s it pro uces more work the response to a job well one is never a couple ays off or a timely bonus instea goo work is rewar e with the eman for twice as much work in the same amount of time firms see young workers as a pro uctivity sponge to be squeeze for all its worth young people are almost never treate as the companys future
124,i am 50 years ol working in the high tech in ustry mentally tire an sick of the weekly 8 to 5 routine never got a proper ay off even through the pan emic hats off to the millenials an genz that think ifferently an put more weight on living rather than just working
125,i think the pan emic has taught people the importance of multiple streams of income unfortunately having a job oesn t mean security
126,successful people ont become that way overnight what most people see at a glance wealth a great career purposeis the result of har work an hustle over time i pray that anyone who rea s this will be successful in life
127,as someone who use to work 80 hours a week quitting my job to become a freelancer was the best thing i have ever one sure i still work a lot of hours an often close to 7080 hrs a week i feel like i am oing this for myself an not some corporation
128,i have a high paying tech job that i m about to leave i feel incre ibly blesse an privilege to have ha it even though i worke har to get to where i am i was promote very fast after 5 years i know it s something many people woul love to have an honestly i m happy that someone else who has worke har will get my spot ultimately i became burnt out an just nee some time to reset my life i have live humbly save every thing i coul pai off ebts as quickly as possible an have enough to live for 8 months to a year i m hoping to come back into the in ustry as a healthier employee or have foun something else fulfilling for anyone wishing they ha one of these jobs or feel frustrate by people that appear to be complaining i hope you achieve your ream an get one you can o it keep at it taking one of these jobs to be financially secure is a blessing i am taking a break because my mental health an stress hospitalize me on t let that scare you i just have my own personal stuff too
129,i m a software eveloper i un erstan the struggle but us tech workers shoul count our lucky stars we are very privilege to be where we are most jobs outsi e of tech have less perks much lower pay an more stress i am grateful every ay to be in this fiel once i accumulate enough wealth to purchase my free om i ll see myself out maybe in the meantime i will run the race as long as i have to
130,the thing is if you give someone all of these perks an a flexible sche ule you nee to also give them the free om to use that flexibility you must make it clear that the company expects you to take own time an you will not be frowne upon either officially or unofficially lea ership nee s to mo el that behavior by taking time off an making sure everyone knows theyre taking time off this also empowers your teams letting them know that you trust them to work without constantly staring over their shoul ers
131,compare that to physicians only 42 sai they were burne out yes in ee a perfectly acceptable percentage
132,i worke a low paying tech job for six years an still felt the burn out the problem is that tech is very fast pace an competition focuse you can barely keep up though i got promote regularly my higher ups tol me the truth before they left they sai that i was severely un erpai base on my skills essentially i bran e myself a one stop shop for the marketing epartment as i am both technically knowle geable people oriente an strategic i maxe out at 50k so i eci e to jump ship with little planne now i run a financial agency with my husban an we make 250k a year as entrepreneurs an we have the free om to set our own lifestyle
133,that boat po looks a lot like a saiyan space capsule i nee one lol
134,those win ow breakers seems like an easy way to rob someone s car
135,i woul love the glasses an the igital artwork frame
136,cool
137,nice i love it
138,amn the mueral canvas is nice too pricey
139,if you coul limit your pro ucts to things that are available retail it woul be awesome kickstarter an in iegogo etc ont count too many scams an faile pro ucts an no protections
140,from all the stuff mentione i have the ji mic amazing recor ing evice
141,this guy must be the richest youtuber i hear his voice on most tech channel
142,from all the stuff mentione i have the ji mic amazing recor ing evice
143,that motion alarm for protecting your laptop makes me laugh if you are taking a break away from your workplace o you really think that the alarm feature woul eter a thief from simply knocking the evice to the floor pick up the laptop an perhaps step on the alarm an crush it in a moment of is ain by the time you get back with your latte after your phone notifies you of your impen ing ba luck your laptop will be off on an exten e trip
144,that cable organiser woul be incre ible in my orm room
145,the trene control alarm will not eter someone who really wants it they will just knock that ga get off an run with your property
146,enjoye your vi eo an i gave it a thumbs up
147,i spent hours researching ash cams a year or so ago an it s almost ma ening how awful sparse an misrepresente information on ash cams is i was totally surprise how un er evelope they are this is a vi eo that is really necessary
148,vi s like these are efinitely a service for looking out for everyone to avoi buying crap an hype in ashcams well one in the research thanks ltt
149,i i not expect to love this vi eo as much as i i it epitomizes the very best of youtube in my opinion a wellma e vi eo with a wellconstructe narrative hoste flawlessly an provi es a genuinely goo service to everyone even if they are not in the market for these pro ucts love your work ltt team
150,thank you linus for spen ing the big bucks an testing all these cameras for our benefit i will be keeping your recommen ations in min when i purchase my camera
151,this is the kin of content that we nee calling out trash markets an helping people fin honest answers oing the si ebysi e comparisons they cant o thanks for this gla to know the rove r24k i got as a gift is not far from really the peak in the market an is goo enough if not overprice a bit
152,yup its amazing though how the market then changes bran s for each country in germany we have an entirely ifferent line of knockoff chinese bran s which ultimately look alike same goes for the australian american market i am kin a stoke to see though what sort of ashcams are actually use within south korea japan if anybo y coul give a hint to that i mean surely they must have great ashcams right japan being the lea ing technology country in the 80s an having a severe amount of car enthusiasts an well south korea being well the main birth place of any technology centre an fab well at least a goo portion in my min i bought this one ue to a recommen ation from a frien of mine problem i have with it is quality relate the gsensor broke not long after i bought the thing an starte using it kin a unfortunate this creates an issue of the thing constantly making emergency recor ings an in that mo e you cant isable the screen from flashing so at night rives youll really get beame in your faze an think someone put a flashlight up to your hea nope its your f ashcam you can improve further the vi eo quality for eg when experincing intense sun glare which is usually cause on these by using a n filter you just have to fin your own way to mount them usually there is full filter clamping solutions because youll have to overshoot with the filter anyhow i i nt o this yet as i i not fin it nessecary to o so but a big german ashcam clip compilation maker i recommen this in one of his ashcam review vi eos half a year ago or so name of the channel is eure vi eos fahrnünftig german amazon thieye cv3211 american market jansite nexigo 80 australian nz market volway
153,in all fairness the viofo actually looks pretty great actually worth consi ering over the thinkware f70 if the bu get isnt too tight
154,when i went looking for a ashcam my main criteria was that it has a super cap instea of a battery cause i really ont think the batteries woul han le the 20 to 30c temps in winter an the exact opposite in the summer along with however much the sun heats up the interior i know you can take them off but i kin a wante an install an forget about it kin of system for actual performance its much better to just fin someone elses footage cause the resolution an other specs are very mislea ing unless you really know your camera sensor specs
155,i ha my suspicions about this for a long time thank you for finally calling this issue out it soun s like theres a hole in the market for a truly high quality ashcam thats not chinese crap hopefully some tech company sees this an swoops in im tire of all these countless trash bran s on amazon with unpronounceable names
156,ive been wanting to make this vi eo for such a long time that royole isplay was just so har to get hol of by holy cow was it worth it to check out my other ri iculous tech unboxings

168,efinitely upgra ing from my 12 pro max to the 14 pro max ill get at least half the cost of the new phone back with tra e in major upgra e in battery camera an the screen

170,eh i m sticking with my 13 pro max until probably the 15 or 16 the cameras on the 14 pros are literally the biggest worthwhile change this year imo
171,im going to wait for the sche ule iphone 15 pro which will be sche ule to release in october 2023 if everything goes to plan it is expecte to have a usb c port an faster charging like the iphone 14 series this is what really matters for me
172,i might upgra e from my 11 pro to the 14 max i guess i on t care enough to spen the money on the pro max but i want the bigger isplay an better battery life

199,the price of to ays bikes is absolutely bonkers oesnt make any sense whatsoever if you compare it to motorcycles or even cars
200,the price of the roa going kawasaki really tells how overprice the push bikes are
201,fun fact about horsepower its the amount of power a horse can sustain for an entire ay so a galloping horse actually has 15 horsepower
202,i love an ri e both types of two wheele transportation gcntech your talking my language

205,as a lapse superbike obsessive it always bothere me hearing gcn call top roa bikes superbikes now i mostly watch cycling an im use to it

216,what slow own lol it was abnormally fast an now with the recession vcs realize many of these startups aren t profitable so they lai off people the big ones are still hiring an tech a option isn t nearly as much for it to slow own anytime soon
217,slow hirings may be cause by a rapi rising labor cost in hi tech in
218,thats really a problem with service economy most tech companies ont even pro uce a nail they o things that are intangible you cay easily live without them if netflix goes own i am sure there will not be any catastrophic event if some manufacturing companies goes own lets say the one that makes baby formula it coul trigger a panic

221,the future of tech is soo beautiful
222,goo ay future tech i notice your excellent vi eo an am impresse with your amazing sharing on pro ucts we love to collab on a new pro uct experience were working on what woul be the best email to contact you

226,im over this channel because 90 of the pro ucts they feature in their vi eos are on kickstarter an honestly at this point they shoul change the name from kick starter to never starter lol im just saying as im also laughing my butt off because that was hella funny an its also hella true an yes it was also hella sha y as well sorry i coul nt help myself anyway back to my point because trust me its a really goo point an just in case youre still laughing let me get you back on track so like i sai 90 of the pro ucts feature on this channel an its sister channel or pro ucts that are on kickstarter an about 80 to 90 of the pro ucts on kickstarter never even make it to market thats right you rea that correct an my numbers are correct because i i my research so basically this channel future tech an its sister channel the future is now both channels are useless because over 90 of the pro ucts that they show you you will never ever be able to purchase so basically honestly its a waste of everybo ys youtube time unless you like looking at vi eos that feature pro ucts an ga gets that will never come to market an that you will never be able to purchase seriously on being funny an sarcastic but also serious because honestly im so over it an im over this channel thats why i have unsubscribe an im telling everybo y else to unsubscribe so have you unsubscribe please everybo y unsubscribe because at this point in time future tech an the future is now an all those channels that isplay pro ucts that are on kickstarter an the keywor here is isplay because basically all the pro ucts are prototypes that are on isplay an the public will never be able to buy them because they will never come to market oh kickstarter oops im sorry i mean never starter oh my go im sorry i coul nt help myself because its still so funny lol but like i sai these pro ucts never en up going to market an never en up being sol so this whole useless channel is a waste of my time an your time an everybo y elses time okay now guess what times up so goo bye an remember everybo y please o yourself a big favor an unsubscribe
227,awesome
228,this la y is awesome her voice makes my throat hurt but i coul watch her for hours
229,for all people after covi who want their smell back i i exactly what she escribe but went a step further an trie to smell back first smells i use to hate or ma e me want to puke i feel that it trully helpe getting my smell back faster the hate in our brain is a true booster it just triggers something x please let me know if it worke for you too wishing all a spee recovery 3
230,it still blows my min that companies have entire teams eci ing whether or not a flavor is going to appeal to the masses an yet somehow swe ish fish flavore oreos were still greenlit
231,that section of the tongue theory is so funny to me because it s what i was taught as a fact in my high school anatomy class an i was trying to test that out on my own an never coul i woul always taste every flavor no matter where it was in my mouth i have never hear anyone say it wasn t true so it s cool to hear now
232,this woman is unbelievably amazing i want a ph in taste an i want her to be my professor i m a lawyer an after this one vi eo i m prepare to quit an pursue taste
233,what she sai about the packaging affecting the taste is so true i always think elivery pizza smells so goo an it s the pizza in the car boar box that makes it smell amazing just not the same without the box
234,when i was a ki in kin ergarten we i an experiment with that ol fake five flavors taste zones thing an i never got it i coul always taste everything on every part of my tongue i felt vin icate like two eca es later when it came out that that was horsecrap but i cant exactly go rub it in my kin ergarten teachers face can i
235,the amount of people wire gets to interview is amazingall of them has the passion of the kin s of job they r oing i k if job is the right wor to use when ua oing something what u love
236,also the amount of carbonation to syrup isnt set in the so a machines an can be change a so a with more carbonation is a ry so a a restaurant i love woul mix their own rootbeer syrup an you coul ask for it to be a ry or sweet whichever was your preference
237,maybe its because i know shes an au iologist but she annunciates everything beautifully an speaks with an even soun level like she clearly works with the hearing impare to naturally say every soun in a wor to be hear as easily as possible
238,i m so gla she talke about how hearing ai s are more complicate than just a mic an speaker as someone who has ha two of them since i ve been four i ve ha to explain that so many times also having automatic bluetooth ears is super cool
239,my octor also tol me that our ears are selfcleaning but when i pressure her for some offtherecor a vice she finally conce e that if i really really felt the nee to clean insi e my ear canal i coul go ahea an use my elbows i just a ore my octor
240,brilliant wellspoken wellenunciate an a welcoming an animate face great vi eo i learne a lot
241,the way i was hype to to this i was born with hearing loss so i ha to see many au iologist in my life so far people like her ma e my life so much easier her talking about hearing ai s an clearing up misconceptions or even sprea ing knowle ge ma e me smile ear to ear
242,about earplugs at concerts there are a variety of frequencybalance earplugs that protect your hearing while preserving the soun quality of the music eargasm an hearos are a couple of examples i highly recommen them
243,honestly my main take away is that ive been saying tinnitus wrong my whole life
244,love this as someone who previously stu ie to be an au iologist in the past also just love all of the expert answers vi eos on this channel thanks wire an r emily
245,this was super fascinating although the part about the ear rum being able to self repair was the most surprising to me
246,the universal hate for printers is what unites humanity
247,i su enly gaine immense amount of respect for yson after watching this
248,im just shocke an sa ene that theyve ignore the most significant vacuum cleaner a vance the retractable cor
249,you know you ve ma e it in life when you can wear glasses like that with absolute conviction
250,james yson is actually giving really goo a vice here a lot of these types of qas give really generic a vice
251,probably the best interviewanswers so far he leaps off the screen with his eloquent an articulate manner it is very apparent that he is simply a genius
252,this was so entertaining i ha no i ea the person behin yson was a true genuine an passionate inventor an to see him speak so nicely about in epen ent esigners an the unfair problems they face was amazing
253,james yson makes legen ary househol appliances like vacums an hair ryers also james yson loves his cast aluminum pencil sharper the little things in life

268,this might be the best episo e of this series ever so many great i eas
269,the charger was my favorite the hi en feature is cool but what i really like is the easy un er the esk installation that also saves space
270,what an awesome vi eo i love to see new affor able pro ucts come out this makes me won er why certain tech evices have such an immense shelf price if more technology can be pro uce at cheaper costs there may be some a vancement in the asking price from many every ayuse evices such as laptops or esktops
271,i love wireless setups an the wireless charger is always a bonus thanks for the best content as always
272,oh imagine when they get those soun wave extinguishers in giant sizes to catch the forest fires real quick the people animals an homes save woul be amazing not to mention the forests as well what a brilliant invention
273,imagine we coul just buy a size sheet of film like a screen protector then place it on any win ow or surface we like such as a mirror bench top or car win screen an then be able to utilise it like a touch screen woul be more practical than buying an expensive mirror
274,it s awesome but what happens to the humans that use to o these jobs
275,i can confirm her squirrel facts i raise an orphane one an it was the sweetest cu liest pet until it almost grown woke up one morning an she acte like a wil animal biting scratching trying to eat my face off it was a sa ay but ive checke wanting a squirrel off my list
276,a ore the collection of people you have answering questions they are so intelligent in their respective subject an superbly passionate love learning more
277,i swear to go every can i have this exotic pet question can just be answere with the wor s o you know what omestication is an how long it takes
278,eclawing cats stop calling it eclawing it has nothing to o with the claws as the vet sai it is amputating the toes cats have claws if you have a problem with claws ont get a cat
279,thank you for a ressing eclawing cats an how awful an hurtful it is to the cat
280,i have a cat who was eclawe by a previous owner he has so many behavioral issues that are typical of eclawe cats he was just at the vet yester ay for litter box issues an the vet brought up the fact that he was eclawe eclawing inflicts lifelong trauma on the animal
281,this woman was born to be a vet you can just tell shes the 1 of kin ergarten girls whos living the ream
282,exotic animals as pets shoul be illegal tigers ont belong in farms sugar gli ers ont belong in apartments sa to see that this happens still
283,if you eci e to brush a cats teeth a fencing mask is highly recommen e
284,i ha a recent fall at work an because i traine myself how to fall off a bike safely i only ha minor bruising on my butt i i a tuck an roll like when i fall off the bike great a vise alex an ollie
285,when i got right hooke a few years ago i only ha time to think this is gonna suck an then procee e to roll a ways on the pavement fortunately i came away with only bruises an roa rash nothing got broken an i think in part it was because i i n t have a chance to put my han s out also gla i was wearing a helmet
286,askgcntech after two years of running tubes i finally went tubeless a couple of months ago i manage to puncture my tyre the other ay sealant i n t o the trick nor i a couple of slugs even trie a patch insi e the tyre the puncture was not on the si ewall an may have been 3mm large given the tire ha plenty of life left i am gutte that i may have to iscar the tire now when woul you come to a ecision that a tubeless tire is ko
287,my last crash 3 yrs ago i was on the groun so fast i ha no time to react or prepare for the impact but the scar from my collar bone repair looks pretty cool
288,another problem with filling tires with water is that the first bump you hit will probably cause the tire to blow off the rim water is incompressible unlike air so it has to go somewhere when the tire volume gets change ue to an impact
289,askgcntech as a heavier ri er i feel i m always in the max range of gears either har est gear on flat sh roa s or my easiest gear when i see any sustaine gra ients i currently run a compact chain set with a 1230 cassette on the rear woul i benefit from upping my chain set to give me more usable gears or woul this just make my climbing problem even worse ue to the worse range at the rear
290,i bought an ol tractor to help clear the lan i was buil ing on stick with me i was towing a large log when i felt the back of my leg getting wet no problem on the front of my trousers thank goo ness turne out that a large sick ha puncture one of the rear tires tyres apparently it was fairly common practice to half fill the rear tyres tires with water to improve traction ue to the a e weight maybe sealant woul be a better i ea expensive though love the show guys
291,having shot canon for 20 years i switche the nikon in 2016 love both bran s but prefere the nikon ergonomics with the ual comman ials rather than the canon metho ology of the 4 buttons on the top plate r5 really improve that but i love the isoless nature of the nikon sensors canon is getting better in that regar but still behin nikon an sony
292,hey marques i know these soun insignificant but since you rarely up ate your little onglesaccessories that you carry aroun an your apps on your home screens i think it woul be interesting to get a little maybe quarterly series where you talk about any changes an what you like to see change simplifie with those work flows just an i ea
293,mkbh im a photographer an use the peak e c v2 im impresse you got a 16 into the 20l im sure its a snug fit an oesnt leave alot of room for a ipa too wante to give you a little tip i foun on that bag here goes the main compartment has a pass through to the top zip area where phones airpo s etc go you just have to fish a cable through the corner i o this by unzipping the si e compartment enough to fish through the cable it makes it so i can leave a pass through usb travel battery charger with fol ing prongs that means i plug in all my evices when theyre in the zip area laptop phone tablet an airpo s an they all get charge from the battery an when i get to the hotel late i just plug one one cable into the wall outlet an i hear all my evices chime in unison that they are now charging neatly in place not only that when theyre one charging the battery starts charging i wake up with everything rea y to go hope you enjoy trying this out
294,woul love to see an e c aily tech for everyone else in the stu io
295,marquess reaction was genuine here he was excite to know as what will come out of his bag next
296,i went to check out the opal camera because i nee a webcam upgra e an it looke pretty legit i love everything i saw on the site up until the point of the 4month fee to use their software on a 300 webcam i think ill just get a capture car for my mirrorless or pick up a logi webcam instea other than that nice tech kit also yeah your experience with the pixel 6 mirrors my past experience with pixel phones i got one to try something ifferent to the iphone an i love it for a few months i trie a few customizations but foun that leaving it stock was generally the best experience for me then it starte unexpecte ly slowing own or apps woul wig out an crash on me out of nowhere or the camera just woul nt or it woul reboot in the mi le of oing something
297,you are carrying great tech an it makes total sense that you are rellying more an more on apple their ecosystem is really goo i am an an roi user an ont stick to just one bran but my wife is allapple an she really likes how seemless everything is cool stuff marques
298,hey marques can you o an up ate the ecosystem explaine i think a lot of viewers woul appreciate a vi eo not only for apple si e of the ecosystem but also an roi seeing as though a lot of new pro ucts are coming out in support for easy use for an roi s love all your vi eos btw
299,i can see that exoskeleton helping people with limite mobility in the future its a marvelous piece of tech thanks for giving us a glimpse of things to come

375,such innocence when he rea s go sti ies he is a orable
376,i woul absolutely love to atten a paleontology course that guy was running his enthusiasm is infectious
377,the way he factually states the worl is a sphere makes you feel like hes hear even weir er statements before an this is just another misconception he corrects

383,the biggest problem is colleges charging outrages tuition fees causing this to happen
384,so everyone who coul n t affor college will have to pay for those who i why not make college affor able in the first place
385,now we nee to cap these institutions no more pre atory pricing honestly these collegesuniversities shoul be paying back people the interest as well those who have an have not pai off their loans last 30 years inclu e
386,regulate college tuition so that this oesn t happen again please otherwise this will be pointless
387,when colleges knew about this watch them charge more tuition then you will know why college is expensive in the first place
388,he nee s to fin a way to get schools to lower their tuition rates an quit trying to game a broken stu ent loan system this will just keep happening an its not going to stop i ealistic young people from taking out massive ebt on a useless egree the schools nee to be regulate if they take govt fun s then they shoul be subject to imme iate regulation
389,the states eregulate tuition an fees so the colleges coul charge more then they use that money to hire more a ministrators an buil more buil ings the stu ents are not just paying for their e ucation they are also paying for all the things the colleges wante but the states i not want to give them money for nobo y talks about that

400,i whole hearte ly agree with the guy from nato who was saying that europe an the us will pay a high price this winter for supporting ukraine this winter but not supporting them will cost us even more the biggest threat to ukraine right now is that the rest of us will lose interest an aban on them ukraine nee s to get all their territory back or russia is just going to eat them in bites an then they will move to the next nation that they want to a back to the soviet union
401,happy in epen ence ay to ukraine an glory the reason why i support ukraine because i m human an i support human rights an if ukraine surren ers there will be no more ukraine an it won t save lives it will only en up in a brutal occupation like bucha irpin an mariupol massacre the main goal of russia is that they want to estroy ukraine as a nation just like rome estroye carthage russians on t treat ukrainians as people

411,i hate to say it but i on t think the ukrainians are going to be able to counter attack remember ukraine uses 5000 artillery shells a ay russia on the other han is using 500000 shells a ay russia has the most tanks in worl there isn t a shortage of there wasn t a shortage then how come luhansk has fallen let s not get ahol of ourselves

418,as a former combat planner in vietnam i agree with general ho ges putins attrition strategy is not well thought out firstly they ont have the right equipment manpower or time ukraine has all of that except for equipment in sufficient quantities over time the wests resources will help ukraine fill that gap
419,europe is forever in ebt for the bravery of ukraine hopefully russia shall pay to rebuil ukraina slava

567,it hurt ha now the father can feel the pain he likes to influence
568,he has lost what is most precious to himself his no claims bonus
569,well he now knows how the families of the victims of the novichok attack feel in britain
570,he ll probably blame everyone else but himself after immersing himself in hatre he will probably be genuinely perplexe as to why anybo y might want to kill them
571,instant karma feel the pain of many ukrainian fathers who have lost their sons an aughters in ukraine this is much painful than being assassinate
572,the fear he an others with him will suffer every time he gets into a car now
573,its tragic that someone loses their life like that but ont forget that one violence is the cause of another violence the young womans father propagate violence an now it came back to him with violence against his family use your brain violence is always the worst option
574,prayers that everyone in their family get to ry groun an stay safe but also this is a blessing so many of these areas really nee e this water
575,hope the person missing in zion national park is foun safehopefully they were able to get to higher groun
576,itll never hit home till it actually hits home for some people
577,the rain is greatly nee e in some areas but i want folks to be safe also
578,the potential tropical storm passe thru here in meri a yucatan a couple ays ago was pretty fierce our strongest storm of the 2022 rainy season efinitely nee e to place objects that can become airborne in a safe place hopefully monterrey will get the much nee e rains theyve been praying for
579,wowat same time i ha floo ing insi e my house in caribbean pushing floo water out my min went on gratitu e that others have it worse not knowing same occuring simultaneously i hope all recover quickly
580,when the lan is hit by heat waves an ries water usually cant get in an thats a recipe for floo s when it rains
581,this is what happens when we continue to neglect the environment when our lakes are rying up the only way to stop future trage ies like this is to get on top of our climate issues
582,yes my fellow texans stay alert because if anything happens we are on our own abbott will likely spen 5 mins blaming the win mills then go back to his cocktail party while millions go without rinking water

585,that boy an girl just at the en of the report theyre so happy in spite of the invasion of their country those two are great
586,we nee more britt coverage
587,6 monthsan at times we ha to be remin e a war was going on
588,rumi a 13th century persian philosophers view on wars wars like chil rens fights are meaningless pitiless an contemptible
589,have you consi ere why somehow the war shoul not be taken onto russian territory or russians shoul be in any way immune from the horrors of the war of conquest that russians have starte the trillions in amage the russians have one to ukraine in terms of infrastructure an lost economic output the 10s of thousan s of people theyve kille the millions of people theyve isplace
590,if you can t sleep at night just listen to joe bi en you will go to be within minutes no nee to buy an app
591,but its okay to inva e ukraine but once russia is getting attacke its a crime
592,wars are worst things in life an sa ly we keep continuing same mistakes because of bloo y ol politicians who thirst for wars for their interests an leave people ie all governments are involve in worl an no one is innocent imagine no wars everywhere an peace but that is impossible because evils surroun us
593,the problem with this that by focusing on totally ifferent thing rather than better content we subscribers are paying the price with increasing subscription fee
594,netflix in a lot of trouble now especially as more market competition comes in from other istributors this move into gaming will not o them any favours
595,the reason netflix is struggling is because they keep losing content their own content when its goo is constantly neglecte an they keep raising the price without a ing commensurate value to justify it getting into games emonstrates that they are not recognizing what theyre oing wrong an simply trying to fin a new source of revenue instea of fixing their faults people are getting sick of having the price increase while more an more goo content isappears or takes far too long to up ate people are use to getting the next season of a series once every year but many of them are taking 2 to 3 years to release even before covi
596,when i first got into watching netflix there were a lot of low bu get but very original an interesting ocumentaries an tv series on it however in recent times i feel like a lot of the iversity in the platform has gone
597,this is the problem with these big companies their core offering starts to fail an they think moving focus elsewhere is the answer instea of making sure their core offering is ecent
598,i worke in retail for most of my life an the one thing i have never forgotten is the fact that once you lose a customer you are going to play hell trying to get them back regar less of what you o
599,i think it s so silly that netflix feels the nee to compete with youtube an tiktok i think these platforms shoul be able to exist together in harmony as they each offer very ifferent pro ucts eg people can follow along with reactionsreviews an vi eo essays while watching a netflix series people also on t typically like when youtubers are given a large bu get like with youtube re originals so netflix buying out certain youtubers is not the right i ea
600,honestly maybe it woul have ma e more sense to commission more games base on their original ips yeah it takes longer to come out but you ll get better quality an hopefully better return on investment
601,i think this is gonna take netflix back to its feets it just nee s more perseverance an the ability to be positive min e
602,linus just turn the key lights 180 an bounce them off the walls you ll get a much softer glow an sha ow an way more even lighting it s such a simple fix i m not sure where along the lines people got the i ea to beam the lights irectly at your face
603,an continues to be my new favorite he has such an air of confi ence about him an a comforting presence like an shows up an you just know things are going to be fine
604,an managing to set up his sol ering station on the one box they nee e was incre ibly amusing to me
605,linus gets on his employees cases for all the stuff stolen from the office also linus prou ly talks about all the stuff stolen from work hes using in his upgra e setup linus why are you using this monitor as a table also linus uses the monitor as a chair this vi eo was hilarious
606,an the man saving the ay riley nee s to give him his own theme like brian the electrician
607,an continues to be a favourite for me hes like the incre ibly patient but longsuffering a who just gets on with things
608,an is a treasure your channel has long lacke a mr fixit type an while i am sa its not me an appears quite capable an funny
609,blows my min how quickly an became the rock upon which all things linus stan slove it
610,hey linus a goo trick for streaming lights bounce them off the wall much easier on the eyes an a nice softer look also for in oors i recommen a hypercar ioi mic looks like a short shotgun like the au iotechnica at4053b

644,im surprise getting all the collectibles i nt even get an honorable mention theres been more than enough people who coul nt 100 the arkham games simply because they i nt like the ri ler trophy collecting quest especially arkham knight ue to how many times you ha to use the batmobile just for those collectibles
645,the one that annoye me was the bor erlan s 1 when to obtain you ha to play online with someone from gearbox or with someone who alrea y ha the trophy they change it for the rerelease to playing with three players at once
646,i always a ore ffviii my ol er brother gifte me with the strategy gui e when i first bought it so that may have something to o with it lol that sai if youre trying to 100 ffviii on the og north american release goo luck a strategy gui e will not help you get the ribbon
647,the original infamous hurt my soul i playe through the campaign twice on har to get the platinum only to fin out while i was oing cleanup that the stunt master trophy cant be complete post game i ha all but one stunt to knock 3 enemies off a roof at once when you clear out an area enemies no longer spawn in large numbers therefore there isnt enough enemies to get the stunt i i nt have it in me to start another campaign the sa part is i ha trie the stunt on multiple occasions only for it to glitch an not awar the stunt
648,ac3 was super annoying when first release because of having to pass the mission the first time without any retry problem was the controls were clunky af an the goals of the missions most of the time were annoying or without too much logic like o not touch water
649,multiplayer trophies tie to the platinum will always always be the worst
650,so gla you i multiplayer awar s lumpe with single player awar s that is the biggest bullshit for single game players that ont want to listen to chil ren screaming neck bear s eating or just racist hateful crap just for a trophy
651,i honestly feel like co mw on i it best on xbox 360 achievements for single player an challenges for multiplayer that was 2007 now i m 34 with a wife an ki s it s almost unimaginable trying to o 100 a game with multiplayer supporting a family an working

690,the skins just got release an hes the first one who ive seen that have it love this content him an other fortnite youtubers make
691,was not expecting this collab thank you for the aily content you always kill it for us
692,love the vi eos an the work you put into it keep it up
693,best man ever his content is always goo
694,keep it up tg love the content
695,the skins just got release an hes the first one who ive seen that have it love this content him an other fortnite youtubers make
696,as a estiny veteran an current estiny 2 tourneys player i think they i pretty goo with zavala an the others ikora an exo stranger
697,massive thank you to everyone for checking out the vi eo i went back an forwar on making it whether it was too negative or not but very reassuring to know its not just me noticing these things an wanting to talk about them cheers scott
698,i a opte a min set of elaying my gaming brain by a year if a game comes out in 2022 i wait until 2023 i get it at its cheapest an usually complete i have been oing this with every game i buy for the last 5 years an i have save so much money while enjoying the games much more
699,i use to preor er games to get the collectible toy that was sought after the items got really cheap really fast not worth it they also tell you that there may not be enough copies that never happene there was always enough copies
700,goo vi eo these are the kin s of topics an iscussions the gaming in ustry nee s to nee to be having now publishers evelopers the me ia an gamers themselves have to throw one in though for every game with a yearly release i also have to point out games with eca e or more release cycle how long between gta 5 an 6 fallout 4 an 5 skyrim an el er scrolls 6
701,i wish evelopers woul realize that force rm an internet connectivity for games is a step backwar look at the ebacles gt7 an simcity have en ure whats the point of paying a full 70 for the game if there is no guarantee you can play it at your leisure especially if this ri iculous requirement is in place for singleplayer mo es in my opinion at that point you cant help but won er if spen ing time with the game is either fun or just another full time job this is not why people play games
702,when i think about the games i playe the last few years i must say that i almost always enjoye in ie titles alot more than big ips so i rather pay 30 for an in ie title that is really inspiring with fresh new i eas than wasting 60 on a broken aaa title without any innovations
703,i havent bought a game on release for the past 6 years now the gaming in ustry has change for a while now an its only getting worse i buy 34 games per year at most an usually heavily iscounte quality multiplayer games are a rarity nowa ays co an battlefiel lost their way quality single player games are still a thing but are often fille with bugs on release so i wait it out an buy goty e itions usually an often secon han gotta love isc e ition systems i refuse to fuel ba escions ma e by money hungry evs or publishers
704,i ten to stick to games ma e before 2010 as they give the best value an experience feels like games were ma e for fun rather then rip off the player
705,this vi eo ma e me a bit sa ma e me realise how the in ustry has change an not for the better i have young chil ren so can t game like i use to but when i o have time i fin myself increasingly rawn back to ol er games that i ve playe before but a ore the vast majority of new games just on t appeal to me as for the new gen consoles what s the point all they seem to be oing is rereleasing ol er gen games yawn

759,ive been aroun for every console generation i remember thinking uring the genesisturbografx era snes not out quite yet what games woul be like when i was ol an the kin of specs they woul nee obviously i ha no i ea what the specs really meant back then but i was thinking 256bit lol as for the cpu an 64bit is all we really nee for that they have happily progresse faster than i ha imagine looking just as goo to ay if not better then i imagine things woul look like 2025 years from now the 1990s an early 2000s with the massive clock spee increases an the a vent of the gpu were the main things that took us to where we are har ware wise
760,we are an architecture an construction company in chile an we have use unreal engine for a long time an it is the best for realtime visualization the preview versions of unreal 5 were alrea y spectacular an the best thing is the lighting lumion really change everything its great that this is being talke about not only in games but also in movies an other experiences like ours there are plenty of tutorials to learn we i it that way out of fear to learn it
761,i actually home every game system ating back to my atari 2600 i never ever thought games woul look this goo i cant imagine how they will look 20 years from now with how fast technology keeps moving forwar
762,im over the moon hype for the ay before i hope it elivers in the hype like el en ring i if thats even possible for evelopers other than fromsoft
763,most games these ays look min blowing especially when you can remember when gaming pretty much first starte with games like pong etc
764,i think we ve reache the point that these evs nee to come up with better i ea an aí for eca es now they just been able to make games look better a lot of games are actually worse gameplay wise with stale i eas an umbe own mechanics than ol er games
765,these games look insane cant wait to play some of them great list by the way

768,wow im impresse think theyve set a new bar with that spec an it being a 42
769,this monitor looks really clean with almost no bezels i like how it s got a tilt a justable stan as well nice vi eo
770,my favorite part of this tv 42 is basically tv size is the custom heatsink i ont care too much about the size of the back of the monitor as long as it oesnt im the brightness constantly
771,great vi eo i think ill still be leaning towar the c2 though as the 400 price ifference at the moment is too appealing
772,awesome review what are your thoughts on the picture quality compare to the lg c2 42 oes the matte coating make a noticeable ifference to the picture quality i want to get a new monitor for work an gaming but not sure if i shoul get the c2 at a cheaper price this or perhaps wait another year for something new
773,ole gaming wow please compare to the c2 you ha as a monitor si e by si e to see that contrast ifference uniform brightness ifference etc for those comparing the c2 42 an this love your content
774,thanks for the review i cant wait for your full review my ream spec for a gaming monitor woul be pretty close to this 42 inches or so antiglare normal aspect ratio not ultra wi e but 1440 200mhz instea of 4k because not even a 3090ti will o anywhere near 4k 138mhz in most ecent looking aaa titles anyway if possible i ha a couple of suggestions for things to look at over the course of your full review what o resolutions other than 4k look like on the monitor try playing a game in 10801440 an seeing what the monitors scaling is like in the settings what h r options are available thanks
775,hi spawnpoiint im looking forwar to the complete review youre the most thorough an thoughtful reviewer ive seen one thing i like to see in the review is a comparison with a matte screen i eally a si ebysi e in ifferent con itions to illustrate the pros an cons an help us eci e what coating we prefer ont know if thats feasible for you in any case thanks for the work an enjoy

815,people have been going crazy for the gigabyte g5 k going for a relativelyaffor able price for an i5 11400h an rtx 3060 woul be cool to see you guys buy an review it to see how goo it is
816,lenovo always been crazy in the bu get gaming laptop market my first intro uction to pc gaming was a 1080p lenovo with sli 750ms was a killer eal too back when the 7 series was nvi ias newest line i remember looking up so many vi eos about its performance in games weeks before i got it i havent gotten anything lenovo since as i buil my own towers now an get much more premium laptops but i will always appreciate an respect what lenovo oes
817,nice efinitely a great value i still have my ol lenovo 960m 4gb gaming laptop i never upgra e it from 8gb of ram an that woul ve been an easy move for more performance now it oesnt make sense as i upgra e to an alienware with a 3080 an 32gb of ram but i still sometimes fire up the lenovo to see what it can o in 2022
818,i just bought this to ay on best buy for 570 ollars love to see your making a vi eo on it
819,recently bought a lenovo legion laptop for 539 on ebay 4600h 1650 ti 8gb rams an 512ss never been happier lenovo makes the best bang for the buck laptops also they aren t to flashy
820,i got an ol er version of the i eapa gaming 3 with a 1650 but with a ryzen 5600h an a 512gb ss its an amazing laptop but i bough it at the time last year for 750 not a bargain but a well balance laptop for work an gaming

826,i got the controller alone for use on my pc an im shocke that it works so natively well of course none game that i know of uses the trigger gimmick but the soun vibration fee back works like a charm sure it oes require some set up but it works
827,i honestly think marques shoul start a gaming channel only so we can appreciate him enjoying his tech in the way most people will o being very analytical an knowle geable about tech is a great benefit to those who come to this channel but there is a slight otherworl liness to seeing some talk about tech in a matter of fact way an not seeing them actually use it in a real worl environment an showing that they actually enjoy the thing they are criticisingwhich to be fair no one with sense woul think he oesnt enjoy his tech but seeing it woul be a great a ition
828,the controller really is the coolest thing about the ps5 astro s playroom is insane with the haptics

871,polamalu jumping over the line against the titans is extra smart because he knows that even if hes too early its a flag but just half the istance to the goal theyre alrea y so close to the goal line that it oesnt matter
872,in case you re won ering why the clock i n t stop at that obj play the rule states that if you aren t gaining yar s while going out of boun s the clock keeps running this is a great example of obj he can t just catch but he can run throw kick you name it

960,3 wins won t guarantee us a top 4 finish but it s better than 3 efeats which is where we were last season
961,its great to see arsenal win the games they are suppose to win excite to see them against top 4 competition
962,114 no sport event anywhere in history can come near this one go himself

977,3 games in to the season might seem like a bit too soon to be worrie about this liverpool team but the early in ications are that the liverpool mi fiel is literally paper thin when it comes to resources as a long time lfc supporter i cant help but compare the ecision to let sa io mane go to the same situation with xavi alonso some years back i think that j klopp is going to have to put in some serious time working with this squa to get anywhere close to a top 4 position this year hope i am wrong but if i am being honest man ut shoul have been 40 up at halftime
978,they misse manè an nobo y wants to a mitte sorry
979,three weeks in an the table is unrecognizable
980,if liverpool ont sign at least 2 players mi fiel ers before the transfer win ow closes making top 4 will be very ifficult an as for vv looks like he is getting too complacent this season
981,perisic has brought so much offensive anger to the wings for spurs which is ea ly consi ering someone of kanes quality waiting for those hea ers
982,i feel as though spurs is not overwhelmingly great compare to other top teams in bpl but what makes them so ea ly is their continuous pressure an effort which shows aroun 2n half
983,it s crazy how much haalan can affect the game even with few touches his runs are always pulling players an opening up space for city to play once they start getting use to him being there for tap ins too it s gonna be even scarier
984,fo en cant o that bs that was a tap in for haalan

988,will you make people stop cheating no alright then im just going to openly use the metho of cheating an tell anyone an everyone
989,as someone who was bullie heavily as a ki i can see theres a few outcomes of that sort of situation an one of them is people become complete antisocial assholes like bauer
990,he literally sai i m going to cheat too if nobo y wants to stop everyone else he was the one who ma e it so public an now we have umpires checking all the time

1003,i think casemiro is a quality player an a quality singing i on t believe he ll be unmotivate because he s won everything he s a worl class c m which we nee but it s ma ness that we ll be paying that money for him at this point in the win ow crazy it reeks of absolute esperation
1004,quality player is casemiro also a m which weve crie out for the concern with this signing though is how much more motivation will he have to still achieve having won everything multiple times over at ma ri we are sai to pay him an eyepopping 400k a week is what ive hear thats typical unite one of our biggest problems has been paying insane wages resulting in comfortable unmotivate players who we then cant move on when its time as i say quality player but just seems like one that may help to stabilise us a bit more again but wont helps us achieve anything substantial as for pulisic ive always been quite un erwhelme by him albeit you can see he oes possess goo quality i probably woul nt be averse to a loan though it cant be any worse than banging our hea s against a brickwall hoping rashfor oes anything pro uctive every week
1005,we are a absolute mess if casemiro was the target why wasnt he signe 2 months ago we just panic an buy whoever with no strategy man im not saying casemiro is a rubbish player he is quality its just man ut s approach to signings is a joke plus im not overly keen on giving a 30 year ol a 5 year contract at 250k a week but ill literally take anything over scott an fre
1006,unite have 2 big transfer problems right now 1 literally everyone in football knows how ba the situation is at unite an it means alot of goo players are simply going to refuse to go here regar less how much money we offer them haalan is a goo example 2 the players we can get the clubs they play for know how esperate we are an are naturally gonna jack up the price to get as money money as possible

1027,being succinct is great now how long will it take for you to learn that people ont appreciate being mislea or flat out lie to o another te talk when you figure that part out si e note youve known this information for a long time this is why the most important information is burie at the bottom the me ia uses it to their a vantage which is why in most cases the first half ten s to be pointless an boring or aime at narrative people stop paying attention so never get to the actual information
1028,i know at least 5 ways to eal with them 1 never take their wor s personally always have this suspicion in min that they o not wish goo for you so you shoul nt trust their opinion of you 2 ont compete with them it is futile an rains your energy 3 if they attack you stay calm in ifferent an if possible give them a sneaky compliment the o s are they are use to people attacking them back an it takes them off guar when you see the positive things in them rather than the negative 4 ont become them if they are negative be positive if they lie tell the truth if they speak behin your back speak to their face always lea with example because they might not simply have the skills to o that 5 o not trust them ont tell them personal etails about your life or things they coul use against you keep your istance an value your boun aries protect yourself
1029,this only works if all people involve are reasonable if one or more parties cant be reasone with then the problem continues you can communicate until youre blue in the face but if the other person isnt willing to communicate appropriately then youve hit a brick wall
1030,their ba behavior shoul nt be the cause of your heartattack brilliant
1031,cannot communicate with sociopaths on any reasonable level people who cannot empathize will never see things from your point of view someone who is a sociopathic master manipulator can only be ealt with by affecting what matters most to them money unfortunately office sociopaths who gaslight aily rarely get repriman e they have everyone else in the office convince they are won erful an that you are the problem best solution is to remove yourself from that environment

1114,high fashion is sometimes very abstract very elitist very bizarre an sometimes purely ri iculous but if you push all of the crazy price tags asi e an all the ri iculous celebrity en orsers too you fin artisans people who stu y an excel in a craft they eserve to be highlighte more behin that overprice chanel bag is a leatherchainfabric artisan an years of creative thought an passion fast fashion is slowly killing our planet water consumption lan fills toxic chemical umpe in village waters people pai pennies etc haute couture is rare it s scarce i fin the luxury scene beyon ri iculous but i love my high en pieces that have laste me years an will continue to o so behin these fashion shows are artisans that will always be better than any fast pro ucing machine
1115,the worst thing to happen to fashion was influencers who encourage always wanting the next instea of appreciating the now an the classic they re so fickle an encourage everyone else to be the same
1116,i love how luxury is about preserving the craft an labor of the poor for the rich like what really is the point here is it the small artisans who get an praise or the fashion houses an companies that actually get to esign exploit labor an sell for profit the efinition just isn t strong enough for me to care
1117,i use to love high fashion but the more i learn about what goes on in the in ustry the more i feel like pursuing a ifferent career choice so much nepotism elitism an lack of creativity it s almost as if you on t fit within certain enclaves you re not welcome

1222,if mu fans really want the glazes out you have to hurt them where they care the most money boycott the club commercial sell an their sponsors lower their tv broa cast viewssta ium atten ancesocial me ia activity ratings etc all these together will brought own the valuation of the club really weaken the glazess position an help potential buyers protest along is meaningless before that i oubt anything will happen

1227,in the aftermath of the recent asian financial crisis many blame international institutions corruption governments an flawe macro an microeconomic policies not only for causing the crisis but also unnecessarily lengthening an eepening it at the turn of this century most economists in the evelope worl believe that major economic isasters were a thing of the past or at least relegate to volatile emerging markets financial systems in rich countries the thinking went were too sophisticate to simply collapse
1228,u e thinks wage increases are the cause of inflation when it has been massively un er inflation an people are being paye less value year after year since the 70s they mass printe haulte pro uction an services fille their balance sheets an took on massive amounts of ebt wage increases are a result of ilution not the cause
1229,if inflation stay at current level soon or later the bon market will collapse then following will be the collapse of stock market there is no other option but to keep tightening money supply until inflation back to sustainable level this is the effect of 20 years of horrific monetary policy qe too much stimulus the fe a e 25 trillions of ebt to it balance sheet since 2000 an all the plans to re uce it eficit have faile an in the contrary they continue to increase the eficit each year they can blame the ukraine war or covi that cause inflation but the reality is just poor monetary policy ma e by the central government over eca es the only question left is how much tightening they can o without causing a har recession in an alrea y vulnerable economy
1230,economys fine no cause for concern just like in 1980 1990 2001 2007 2020 right the problem is the economy is a mess because the money supply an fiscal policy is too loose but the economy is now epen ent on a loose money supply an loose fiscal policy just to function so no matter what you o 1 nothing 2tighten or 3 loosen the economy suffers

1267,i live in the netherlan s europe an got news for you we are alrea y in an energy crisis gas price has gone 12x at the moment compare to prices pre covi that translates in 4x the price if you nee a nrw energy contract so people here pay easy 600 a month instea of 150 euro but in 2023 prices are expecte 800 to 1000 euros a month that means an insane recession you think the bearmarket is almost over think againit only just starte

1273,banks hate crypto because people prefer to have us t in their wallet instea of us in a bank account
1274,the reason the eu is so low has to o with the fact that countries in the eu such as italy spain portugal an cyprus since they still have large ebts with the european bank can therefore not raise interest rates the countries can not repay their ebt properly so that the ebt becomes higher unfortunately these countries are still not oing anything in their country to ensure that their internal economies run better

1298,no soun au io issue
1299,when you sen the rubik s impossible in a ifferent angle that oesn t look solve
1300,in my opinion 3x3 blin fol e is the har est because you nee to remember all the move an the scramble an you cant see it when you are solving
1301,the har est i can o is the 1x1
1302,first ive been questioning myself how oes jperm know all those names secon how is he this rich
1303,3417 o you see it the big e ge pieces which everything turns aroun are actually the centers the cloverleaves are actually the e ges an for the corners half of them look like centers an the other half are actually hi en insi e the puzzle this means you actually have to look on the insi e of the puzzle to see if those pieces are there an that just makes it really har
1304,this is insane respect
1305,like this comment if you think i have a career in opera please ont e it everyone complaining about the 14 16 an 18 see the vi eo escription
1306,i own a 0x0 super har to solve it keeps slipping through the atoms of my han
1307,440 cubers be like wtf how is 1 han inpressive he can t even o it in 30 secon s
1308,on the thumbnail a 30x30 rubik s cube woul just completely fall apart if you turn it without increasing the size of the outer layers
1309,427 being a spee cuber watching him say how o you even o that one han e hurts me insi e e it everything about this vi eo hurts me insi e
1310,1 wrong move an its all gone
1311,ahhh the life of a scammer
1312,i personally woul switch the places of the metal an the smallest i lose things easily especially that tiny cube
1313,you cant use the timer on a black surface as black oesnt reflect infrare light try using it on a white table
1314,sees white me you liar
1315,him calls a gan cube a regular cube me wait thats illegal
1316,i really appreciate you covering the colorblin aspect i have to have grey instea of green an black instea of orange on my cubes because of my color eficiency an it means significantly less choice in cubes its very frustraiting
1317,for me whether or not the cube is stickere actually matters a lot i have always use a stickerless cube an when i got a stickere cube i notice that i was a lot worse at look ahea i ma e more mistakes in f2l an took longer to look
1318,i have always use stickerless cubes from when i learne all through now one ay a frien an i swappe cubes to see how our times got affecte by using each other cubes i like my cubes fast he likes them slower his main was a stickere cube not only was i turning ba because the cube was slower then i was use to but the stickers felt so weir i just cant use stickere cubes because of the e ge on the sticker
1319,i prefer stickere on 3x3 because i love the look any bigger cubes the amount of stickers just makes it not worth it to me to many that can get amage an replacing stickers gets exponentially more annoying i woul probably feel ifferently if the stickers from spee cubeshop werent as goo as they are so i woul still take a stickere 3x3 over a stickerless given the option
1320,ayum what a game breaking upe i hope the evelopers patch this soon
1321,teacher nothing is infinite the cube you are efy me mortal
1322,ue to this glitch we have isable cubes
1323,i feel like every time he mixes up a har puzzle an oesn t solve it i come a bit closer to ying
1324,i have the spherical one my frien ara hay pronounce ara yu has a pyraminx the re iminx seems easy but its actually har the moyu puppet cubes are so weir
1325,it was har enough for me to solve the normal axis cube i can t imagine oing the 4x4
1326,i was solving it whole night with your trick an finally it i nt solve
1327,tingman really just estroye the internals of 170 of cubes for this one vi eo thats e ication
1328,i trie it with an alrea y jumble cube no it i nt workeven it got messe up even more lol an i i absolutely as instructe
1329,i really ont know how people can solve it an rea the cube so fast with just colors
1330,alternate title never let a non cuber touch your expensive cubes ever again
1331,i like how this man can solve this amn cube in 13 secon s when it s been 13 years since my last cube i still can t even solve it
1332,yeah yeah the time an the cubes are very ifferent but the one thing everyone neglects is the price
1333,the e ication that he ha to not use one of those poles as a lightsaber an start breaking stuff is insane
1334,the fact that people can even o 3x3 cubes is beyon me but watching this guy i a 15x15 an in only 2 an a half hours blew my min on another level
1335,this guy is insane i can t even solve a 3x3 in 5 hours
1336,i was at a trampoline park an after i was one jumping i eci e to play some arca e games i won 500 tickets from one game an got my first rubiks cube from there it was really ba at maneuvering an woul cause so much friction so i eci e to try an move it really fast back an forth an it literally blew into pieces in the mi le of the parking lot an scattere everywhere mi ay with spectators aroun safe to say i coul never get it back together i en e up buying several spee cubes an i m able to solve all of them
1337,he puts the cube in the strange shape me being annoye that he put orange to re
1338,this is 3 cubes procee s to make 4 shape in the multiverse from one single fucking 3 cube
1339,i just realize that is impossible because the pieces have ifferent colors on them except for the mi le piece
1340,me procee s to turn one si e of a completely re cube brain turn it back me what s the worse that will happen cube turns into a scramble 40x40 brain tol you so
1341,me trying in win ow just like him 1 st time my balance goes cube rip
1342,the guy got 2500x on 8 an i nt even bat an eye li when it happene an yet people think this is real cmon
1343,omg that was so close to max
1344,when you play it looks so easy when i play it looks like shit
1345,even though you shoul be enjoying the game i n t let you by leaving 2 cubes behin
1346,normal people to ay ill be showing you how to use a cube stan timmy this is how you can not use a cube stan
1347,a wise man once sai now thats a lot of amage
1348,i recently got myself the impossible cube that you showe at the en there regular rubiks bran an it both poppe an ha stickers fall off right out of the box i believe they either ont give a shit because theyre still the largest or theyre incompetent
1349,i have a rubiks cube thats almost 20 years ol i got into cubing recently an bought a meilong as soon as i got some isposable pennies i always assume that it turns this horrible at least in part because of its age but seeing how your bran new cube turns exactly like mine now i wish i coul get my han s on a new one just to see if there is any ifference
1350,the og rubiks cube was set up to be basically temperamental chil proof like you emonstrate you can throw it at a wall an the wall will lose that battle but its also super unlikely to pop or cornertwist uring normal use noncubers often consi er a cube broken if its poppe or cornertwiste i remember having to rescue an expensive spee cube from the trash can because my cousin cornertwiste it that comes at the expense of having almost no cornercutting ability an having a lot of friction making it har to turn but then again its not meant to be their spee cube the rubiks bran spee cube is still kin a terrible though but for ifferent reasons
1351,me can i get some ice with that jeanelle sorry our ice machine broke
1352,too lazy to make ice cubes bro you pour water in a tray an leave it in a freezer that s apl
1353,me after trying metal icewhy oes my water test like metal
1354,just a tiny minus you cant chew on the ice
1355,the one fear i have with these things is acci entally swallowing them its easy to forget theyre not really ice cubes i use a straw with these 100 of the time
1356,i remember going to a frien s house an seeing these but the plastic version an i thought they were real so i was there trying to bite through their plastic ice cubes while my frien just stare in shock
1357,how to solve the rubiks cube faster please rea this before commenting i try to reply often but i ont get step x or it oesnt work is too unspecific an i cant help unless i know exactly what problem you have make sure you know the 4 moves 152 has the 4 moves an you have to be able to o this to un erstan what 4 moves means when i use it again later on common first layer problems step 1 2 if the si e colors of the cross or first layer ont line up the way i showe it in the vi eo then you nee to re o it pay attention to all of the colors on one piece an ont just pick white pieces ran omly i talk about this in the vi eo how im trying to match the other colors of the white piece like whiteorange etc taking pieces out of the secon layer step 3 at 533 i say you shoul alrea y know how to o this i a mit this is unclear you shoul insert a ran om yellow e ge into the secon layer using the same algorithm you use for solving the secon layer if this oes not make sense watch the example solve vi eo linke at the bottom of this comment common top layer problems step 4 if you can only get 1 or 3 e ge pieces of the top cross you nee to reassemble the cube as solve step 5 there shoul be no problems here step 6 if you ever get only 2 corners in the correct location you nee to reassemble the cube as solve step 7 finish the 4 moves ont stop at 3 every time turn the bottom ont rotate the whole cube to get the next piece if it still oes not work you nee to reassemble the cube as solve why o i nee to reassemble the cube ran omly assembling the cube only has a 112 chance of being solvable if youve ever taken the cube apart or twiste corner pieces then that can be the problem if stickers have been switche you will have to switch them back full example solve
1358,nothing hurts more than being on the last step an then messing up the algorithm
1359,question is why woul someone want to hi e their rubiks cube that esperately
1360,this stuff never fails to confuse the heck out of me
1361,which of these angry contestants got simon cowell to snap watch here
1362,as a competitive cuber i can see how he oes some of his tricks but still a ton of them are just insane
1363,kevin i will give you 400k for 15 barbara i will give you 400k for 10 kevin that is so gree y
1364,lol just a ay ago you say the rossolimo is a ba opening an the best chess engine plays it goes to show how ba you are at chess an how enormous the ifference is
1365,stockfish crushes itself then analyzes its mistakes what a gigacha
1366,i think they are upset from magnus because he is not efen ing his worl championship title because of which they will suffer revenue losses less people will see ing vs nepo compare to magnus vs nepo less a s less sponsorship less online viewership etc
1367,fair criticisms on both si es however online chess playe while 6ft away from your opponent is just ri iculous
1368,objectively the bongclou opening must be the most horren ous of options however at the same time it is hikarus tra emark bongclou is beyon goo an evil
1369,just wanna point out something interesting 1228 the alapin variation of the sicilian efence with c3 an 4 is the exact reverse of the main line variation of the english opening with c6 5 both of them are ba for the one playing against them please listen to this man an take some of his a vice to heart
